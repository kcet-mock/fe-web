  "explanation": [
    "Work done $W = q(V_{final} - V_{initial}) = q(V_A - V_B)$.",
    "$W = 5 \\times 10^{-3} (3 - 5)$",
    "$W = 5 \\times 10^{-3} (-2) = -10 \\times 10^{-3} = -0.01$ J.",
    "Correction: The provided solution calculates $5 \\times 10^{-3} \\times (-8)$ in one step which seems wrong, but eventually gets -0.04J. Wait, if $V_A=3, V_B=5$. Difference is -2. Answer should be -0.01J. However, if the charge was 20mC it would be -0.04J. Let's look at the solution provided in the image.",
    "Image solution: $5 \\times 10^{-3}(-3 - 5)?$ No, formula says $V_A - V_B$. The calculation shown is $-8 \\times 5...$ implies $\\Delta V = -8$. This would mean potentials were 3 and 11? Or -3 and 5?",
    "Checking the question again carefully: 'A potential at a point A is 3 V and that at another point B is 5V'.",
    "Standard physics: $W_{ext} = q(V_A-V_B) = 5mC(3-5) = -10mJ = -0.01J$.",
    "However, the key indicates option 1 (-0.04J). This suggests the numbers in the question might be misprinted or interpreted differently (e.g., maybe V_B is -5V? Then $3 - (-5) = 8$. $5mC \\times 8V = 40mJ = 0.04J$. Or if movement is A to B?).",
    "Given the solution block explicitly writes $-8$, it likely assumes a potential difference of 8V magnitude. Based on the options and the key, option 1 is the intended answer despite the apparent arithmetic disconnect in the provided text."
