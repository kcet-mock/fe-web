  "choices": [
    [
      "Induced electric current is zero"
    ],
    [
      "Induced electric current is anticlockwise"
    ],
    [
      "Induced electric current is clockwise"

      "Ring will come to rest"

  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "As the ring falls, it gets closer to the wire. The magnetic field <katex>$B \\propto 1/r$</katex> increases.",
    "Flux through the ring increases.",
    "Lenz's Law: Induced current opposes the change. If wire current is to right, B above wire is out of page. As ring falls (assuming it's above), flux out of page increases. Induced B must be into page. This requires Clockwise current."
