  "question": [
    "For a given electric current the drift velocity of conduction electrons in a copper wire is v and their mobility is <katex>$\\mu$</katex> . When the current is increased at constant temperature"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "<katex>$V_{d}$</katex> decreases, <katex>$\\mu$</katex> remains the same"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$V_{d}$</katex> remains the same, <katex>$\\mu$</katex> decreases"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$v_{d}$</katex> increases, <katex>$\\mu$</katex> remains the same"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$v_{d}$</katex> remains the same, <katex>$\\mu$</katex> increases"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "<katex>$I = n A e v_d$</katex>. If I increases, <katex>$v_d$</katex> increases. Mobility <katex>$\\mu = v_d/E = (e\\tau/m)$</katex> depends on material and temperature (relaxation time), so it remains constant at constant temperature."
