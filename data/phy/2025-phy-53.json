    "Based on the standard circuit configuration: <katex>$D_1$</katex> is reverse biased (open) and <katex>$D_2$</katex> is forward biased (closed).",
    "The circuit path is through <katex>$30 \\Omega$</katex> (bottom) and <katex>$70 \\Omega$</katex>.",
    "Total Resistance <katex>$R = 30 + 70 = 100 \\Omega$</katex>.",
    "Current <katex>$I = V/R = 3/100 = 0.03$</katex> A."
