    "You are given a dipole of charge +q and -q separated by a distance 2R. A sphere 'A' of radius 'R' passes through the centre of the dipole as shown below and another sphere 'B' of radius '2R' passes through the charge +q. Then the electric flux through the sphere A is",

  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "According to the diagram and description:",
    "Sphere A of radius R passes through the center of the dipole. The dipole length is 2R, so the center to either charge is R.",
    "Sphere A is centered at -q (based on standard interpretation of such diagrams where A encloses one charge).",
    "If A encloses -q, by Gauss's Law, Flux <katex>$\\phi = \\frac{q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_0} = \\frac{-q}{\\epsilon_0}$</katex>."
