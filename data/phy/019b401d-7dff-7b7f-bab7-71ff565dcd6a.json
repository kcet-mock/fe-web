  "question": [
    "Ten identical cells each emf 2V and internal resistance 1 $\\Omega$ are connected in series with two cells wrongly connected. A resistor of 10 $\\Omega$ is connected to the combination. What is the current through the resistor?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "0.6 A"
    ],
    [
      "1.2 A"
    ],
    [
      "1.8 A"
    ],
    [
      "2.4 A"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Effective EMF = $(10-2\\times2)E = 6E = 12V$.",
    "Total resistance = $10r + R = 10 + 10 = 20\\Omega$.",
    "Current $I = 12/20 = 0.6$ A."
