  "question": [
    "In an experiment to determine the figure of merit of a galvanometer by half deflection method, a student constructed the circuit shown. He unplugged a resistance of 5200Ω in R. When K1 is closed and K2 is open, the deflection observed is 26 div. When K2 is also closed and a resistance of 90Ω is removed in S, the deflection becomes 13 div. The resistance of galvanometer is nearly",

  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "For half deflection method, G ≈ S (if R >> G).",
    "More accurately, G = RS / (R - S).",
    "G = 5200 * 90 / (5200 - 90) = 468000 / 5110 ≈ 91.58 Ω.",
