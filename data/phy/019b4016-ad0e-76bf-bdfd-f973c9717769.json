  "question": [
    "A p-n junction diode is connected to a battery of emf 5-7 V in series with a resistance 5 $k\\Omega$ such that it is forward biased. If the barrier potential of the diode is 0-7 V, neglecting the diode resistance, the current in the circuit is"

      "1.14 mA"
    ],
    [
      "1 mA"

    [
      "1 A"
    ],
    [
      "1.14 A"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Net voltage $V = 5.7 - 0.7 = 5.0$ V.",
    "Resistance $R = 5 k\\Omega = 5000 \\Omega$.",
    "Current $I = V/R = 5/5000 = 1 \\times 10^{-3}$ A = 1 mA."
