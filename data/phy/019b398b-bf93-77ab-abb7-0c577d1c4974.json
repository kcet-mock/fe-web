    "Under electrostatic condition of a charged conductor, which among the following statements is true?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "The electric field on the surface is σ/2ε₀"
    ],
    [
      "The electric potential inside is always zero"
    ],
    [
      "Any excess charge resides on the surface of the conductor"
