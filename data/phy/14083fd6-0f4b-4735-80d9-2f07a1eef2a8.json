  "question": [
    "The anode voltage of a photocell is kept fixed. The frequency of the light falling on the cathode is gradually increased. Then the correct graph which shows the variation of photo current I with the frequency v of incident light is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Graph showing current zero until threshold, then constant"
    ],
    [
      "Graph increasing linearly"
    ],
    [
      "Graph decreasing"
    ],
    [
      "Graph exponential"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Photoelectric effect occurs only above threshold frequency <katex>$\\nu_0$</katex>.",
    "Once emission starts, if intensity is constant, the photocurrent (number of electrons) is nearly independent of frequency (assuming saturation).",
    "However, the PDF solution indicates graph 1, likely step up at <katex>$\\nu_0$</katex>."
