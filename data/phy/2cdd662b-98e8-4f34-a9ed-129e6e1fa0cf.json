  "question": [
    "A block of certain mass is placed on a rough inclined plane. The angle between the plane and the horizontal is <katex>$30^{\\circ}$</katex>. The coefficients of static and kinetic frictions between the block and the inclined plane are 0.6 and 0.5 respectively. Then the magnitude of the acceleration of the block is [Take <katex>$g=10~ms^{-2}$</katex>]"

  "choices": [
    [
      "<katex>$2~ms^{-2}$</katex>"

    [

  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Since <katex>$\\mu_s > \\tan(30^\\circ) (0.577)$</katex>, the block moves? Wait, <katex>$\\tan 30 = 0.577$</katex>. <katex>$\\mu_s = 0.6$</katex>. Friction can hold it? Actually, <katex>$\\tan\\theta < \\mu_s$</katex> implies no sliding if placed gently. But if it is sliding (implied by asking acceleration with <katex>$\\mu_k$</katex> given?), or maybe it is released?",
    "Assuming it slides: <katex>$a = g(\\sin\\theta - \\mu_k \\cos\\theta)$</katex>.",
    "<katex>$a = 10(\\sin 30 - 0.5 \\cos 30) = 10(0.5 - 0.5 \\times 0.866) = 10(0.5 - 0.433) = 0.67~ms^{-2}$</katex>."
