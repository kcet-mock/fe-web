    "Pressure of ideal gas at constant volume is proportional to"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Total energy of the gas"
    ],
    [
      "Average kinetic energy of the molecules"
    ],
    [
      "Force between the molecules"
    ],
    [
      "Average potential energy of the molecules"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "For an ideal gas, pressure is proportional to temperature (<katex>$P \\propto T$</katex>) at constant volume. The total internal energy (which is purely kinetic for ideal gas) is also proportional to <katex>$T$</katex> (<katex>$U \\propto T$</katex>). Thus <katex>$P$</katex> is proportional to total energy."
