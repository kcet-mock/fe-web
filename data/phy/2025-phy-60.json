  "question": [
    "A particle is in uniform circular motion. The equation of its trajectory is given by <katex>$(x-2)^2 + y^2 = 25$</katex>, where x and y are in meter. The speed of the particle is <katex>$2 ms^{-1}$</katex> when the particle attains the lowest 'y' co-ordinate, the acceleration of the particle is (in <katex>$ms^{-2}$</katex>)"

  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Circle equation <katex>$(x-2)^2 + y^2 = 5^2$</katex>. Center at (2,0), Radius R=5.",
    "Centripetal acceleration <katex>$a_c = \\frac{v^2}{R} = \\frac{2^2}{5} = 0.8 m/s^2$</katex>.",
    "At the lowest y-coordinate (y=-5), the center is directly above.",
    "Acceleration is directed towards the center (positive y direction).",
    "So <katex>$\\vec{a} = 0.8 \\hat{j}$</katex>."
