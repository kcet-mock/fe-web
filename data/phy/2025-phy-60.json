  "question": [
    "A particle is in uniform circular motion. The equation of its trajectory is given by <katex>$(x-2)^2 + y^2 = 25$</katex>, where x and y are in meter. The speed of the particle is <katex>$2ms^{-1}$</katex>. When the particle attains the lowest 'y' co-ordinate, the acceleration of the particle is"

  "choices": [
    [
      "<katex>$0.4\\hat{j}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$0.8\\hat{i}$</katex>"

    [
      "<katex>$0.4\\hat{i}$</katex>"

  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Equation of circle: <katex>$(x-2)^2 + y^2 = 5^2$</katex>. Center is at (2, 0), Radius R = 5m.",
    "Lowest y-coordinate implies the bottom of the circle.",
    "Centripetal acceleration <katex>$a_c = \\frac{v^2}{R} = \\frac{2^2}{5} = 0.8 m/s^2$</katex>.",
    "At the lowest point, the acceleration is directed towards the center (upwards, positive y direction).",
    "So, <katex>$\\vec{a} = 0.8\\hat{j}$</katex>."
