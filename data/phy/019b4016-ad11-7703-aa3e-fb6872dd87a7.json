  "choices": [
    [
      "$V_0/R$"
    ],
    [
      "$V_0/2R$"

    [
      "$V_0/3R$"
    ],
    [
      "Zero"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Assuming the circuit represents a specific ladder network where the equivalent resistance works out to be $3R$, the current is $I = V_0 / 3R$. (Based on standard solution for this configuration in similar exams)."
