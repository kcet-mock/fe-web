  "question": [
    "The anode voltage of a photocell is kept fixed. The frequency of the light falling on the cathode is gradually increased. Then the correct graph which shows the variation of photo current I with the frequency v of incident light is"

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Below the threshold frequency, photo current is zero.",
    "Once frequency exceeds threshold, emission occurs. If intensity is constant, saturation current is constant.",
    "Graph shows current jumping up at v0 and staying constant.",
