  "question": [
    "A capacitor of capacitance $5\\mu F$ is charged by a battery of emf 10 V. At an instant of time, the potential difference across the capacitor is 4 V and the time rate of change of potential difference across the capacitor is $0.6Vs^{-1}$. Then the time rate at which energy is stored in the capacitor at that instant is"

  "explanation": [
    "Energy $U = \\frac{1}{2}CV^2$. Rate $\\frac{dU}{dt} = CV \\frac{dV}{dt}$.",
    "Power $= 5\\times10^{-6} \\times 4 \\times 0.6 = 12 \\times 10^{-6}$ W = 12 μW."
