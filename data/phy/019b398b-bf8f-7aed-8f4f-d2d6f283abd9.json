  "question": [
    "In Young's double slit experiment, an electron beam is used to produce interference fringes of width β₁. Now the electron beam is replaced by a beam of protons with the same experimental set-up and same speed. The fringe width obtained is β₂. The correct relation between β₁ and β₂ is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "β₁ = β₂"
    ],
    [
      "No fringes are formed"
    ],
    [
      "β₁ < β₂"
    ],
    [
      "β₁ > β₂"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Fringe width β ∝ λ.",
    "de Broglie wavelength λ = h/mv.",
    "Mass of proton > Mass of electron. For same speed, λ_proton < λ_electron.",
    "Therefore, β₂ (proton) < β₁ (electron), or β₁ > β₂."
