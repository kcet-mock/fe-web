  "question": [
    "The total energy carried by the light wave when it travels from a rarer to a non-reflecting and non-absorbing medium"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "remains same"
    ],
    [
      "increases"
    ],
    [
      "either increases or decreases depending upon angle of incidence"
    ],
    [
      "decreases"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "If the medium is non-reflecting and non-absorbing, there is no loss of energy. By the law of conservation of energy, the total energy carried by the wave remains constant upon transmission."
