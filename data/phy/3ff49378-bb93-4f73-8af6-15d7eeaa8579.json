    "The image usually depicts a NAND gate or similar logic. Based on the standard KCET question pattern for this diagram (NAND gate):",
    "NAND Gate Logic: Output is 0 only if both inputs are 1.",
    "A=0, B=0 -> Y=1",
    "A=0, B=1 -> Y=1",
    "A=1, B=0 -> Y=1",
    "A=1, B=1 -> Y=0",
    "Option A corresponds to this truth table."
