    "The anode voltage of a photocell is kept fixed. The frequency of the light falling on the cathode is gradually increased. Then the correct graph which shows the variation of photo current I with the frequency v of incident light is",

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Below the threshold frequency $\\nu_0$, no photoelectric effect occurs ($I=0$).",
    "Above $\\nu_0$, if intensity is constant and voltage is sufficient for saturation, the current depends on the number of photons (intensity), not frequency.",
    "Thus, current rises at $\\nu_0$ and remains constant. Graph 1 represents this theoretical behavior."
