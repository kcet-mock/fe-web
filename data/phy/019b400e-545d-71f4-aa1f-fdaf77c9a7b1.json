  "question": [
    "In the projectile motion of a particle on a level ground, which of the following remains constant with reference to time and position?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Average velocity between any two points on the path"
    ],
    [
      "Horizontal component of velocity"
    ],
    [
      "Angle between the instantaneous velocity with the horizontal"
    ],
    [
      "Vertical component of the velocity of the projectile"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "In projectile motion (neglecting air resistance), there is no acceleration in the horizontal direction ($a_x = 0$).",
    "Therefore, the horizontal component of velocity ($u \\cos \\theta$) remains constant throughout the flight."
