  "question": [
    "During an elastic collision between two bodies, which of the following statements are correct?",
    "I. The initial kinetic energy is equal to the final kinetic energy of the system.",
    "II. The linear momentum is conserved.",
    "III. The kinetic energy during <katex>$\\Delta t$</katex> (the collision time) is not conserved."
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "II and III only"
    ],
    [
      "I and III only"
    ],
    [
      "I, II and III"
    ],
    [
      "I and II only"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "In an elastic collision:",
    "1. Total kinetic energy before collision = Total kinetic energy after collision.",
    "2. Linear momentum is always conserved.",
    "3. During the short time of collision, some kinetic energy is converted into potential energy of deformation, so KE is not conserved *during* the impact.",
    "Therefore, all statements I, II, and III are correct."
