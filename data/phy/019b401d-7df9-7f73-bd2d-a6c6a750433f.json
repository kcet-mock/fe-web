  "question": [
    "A point object is moving at a constant speed of $1ms^{-1}$ along the principal axis of a convex lens of focal length 10cm. The speed of the image is also $1ms^{-1}$, when the object is at cm from the optic centre of the lens."

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Image speed equals object speed when magnification $|m| = 1$.",
    "For a real inverted image ($m=-1$), the object must be at $2f$.",
    "$2f = 2 \\times 10 = 20$ cm."
