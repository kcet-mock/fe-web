  "question": [
    "A square loop of side length 'a' is moving away from an infinitely long current carrying conductor at a constant speed 'v' as shown. Let 'x' be the instantaneous distance between the long conductor and side AB. The mutual inductance (M) of the square loop - long conductor pair changes with time (t) according to which of the following graphs?",

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "The magnetic field B due to the long wire varies as 1/x. As the loop moves away, the distance x increases linearly with time (x = vt).",
    "The flux Φ through the loop involves integrating B over the area, leading to a logarithmic dependence on distance (Φ ∝ ln((x+a)/x)).",
    "Since Mutual Inductance M = Φ/I, M decreases as distance increases. The decrease is non-linear (logarithmic nature), matching graph A."
