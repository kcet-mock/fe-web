    "images/2025-phy-25-1.png"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "X copper, Y - semiconductor, Z - nichrome"
    ],
    [
      "X-semiconductor, Y nichrome, Z copper"
    ],
    [
      "X-nichrome, Y copper, Z - semiconductor"
    ],
    [
      "X copper, Y - nichrome, Z - semiconductor"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "X increases linearly with T: Copper. [cite: 424]",
    "Y has high resistivity and weak T dependence: Nichrome. [cite: 424]",
    "Z decreases with T: Semiconductor. [cite: 424]"
