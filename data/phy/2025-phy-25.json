  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "X copper, Y - semiconductor, Z - nichrome"
    ],
    [
      "X - semiconductor, Y nichrome, Z copper"
    ],
    [
      "X - nichrome, Y copper, Z - semiconductor"
    ],
    [
      "X copper, Y - nichrome, Z - semiconductor"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "X shows linear increase with Temp: Metal (Copper).",
    "Y shows weak dependence/high rho: Alloy (Nichrome).",
    "Z shows decrease with Temp: Semiconductor."
