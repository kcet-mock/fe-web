  "question": [
    "The variations of resistivity <katex>$\\rho$</katex> with absolute temperature T for three different materials X, Y and Z are shown in the graph below. Identify the materials X, Y and Z.",
    "images/2025-phy-25-1.png"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "X - copper, Y - semiconductor, Z - nichrome"
    ],
    [
      "X - semiconductor, Y - nichrome, Z - copper"
    ],
    [
      "X - nichrome, Y - copper, Z - semiconductor"
    ],
    [
      "X - copper, Y - nichrome, Z - semiconductor"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "X: Resistivity increases non-linearly with temperature (Typical of metals/conductors like Copper).",
    "Y: Resistivity is high and increases weakly/linearly with temperature (Typical of alloys like Nichrome).",
    "Z: Resistivity decreases with temperature (Typical of Semiconductors).",
    "Therefore: X-Copper, Y-Nichrome, Z-Semiconductor."
