  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "X - copper, Y - semiconductor, Z - nichrome"
    ],
    [
      "X - semiconductor, Y - nichrome, Z - copper"
    ],
    [
      "X - nichrome, Y - copper, Z - semiconductor"
    ],
    [
      "X - copper, Y - nichrome, Z - semiconductor"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": [
    "X: Resistivity increases linearly/curved with T (Metal/Copper).",
    "Y: Resistivity is high and changes slowly with T (Alloy/Nichrome).",
    "Z: Resistivity decreases with T (Semiconductor).",
    "Matching: X-Copper, Y-Nichrome, Z-Semiconductor."
