    "In the Young's double slit experiment, the intensity of light passing through each of the two double slits is <katex>$2\\times10^{-2}Wm^{-2}$</katex>. The screen-slit distance is very large in comparison with slit-slit distance. The fringe width is <katex>$\\beta$</katex>. The distance between the central maximum and a point P on the screen is <katex>$x=\\frac{\\beta}{3}.$</katex> Then the total light intensity at that point is"
