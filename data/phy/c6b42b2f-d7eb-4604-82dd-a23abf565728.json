  "question": [
    "During an elastic collision between two bodies, which of the following statements are correct?",
    "I. The initial kinetic energy is equal to the final kinetic energy of the system.",
    "II. The linear momentum is conserved.",
    "III. The kinetic energy during the collision time is not conserved."
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "II and III only"
    ],
    [
      "I and III only"
    ],
    [
      "I, II and III"
    ],
    [
      "I and II only"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "In an elastic collision, total KE is conserved (Initial = Final), so I is correct.",
    "Linear momentum is always conserved, so II is correct.",
    "During the brief collision interaction, some KE is stored as elastic potential energy, so KE is not conserved instantaneously during impact. Thus III is also correct."
