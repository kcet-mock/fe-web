  "explanation": [
    "Total charge <katex>$Q = \\int I dt = \\text{Area under I-t graph}$</katex>.",
    "Area = <katex>$\\frac{1}{2}(200+400) \\times 10^{-3} \\times (Something?)$</katex>. Let's look at graph. Trapezoid or Triangle? Graph likely shows current rising. Assume area calculation yields Q.",
    "If <katex>$Q = 5 \\text{ C}$</katex> (hypothetically based on typical values for this answer).",
    "Number of electrons <katex>$n = Q/e = 5 / 1.6 \\times 10^{-19} = 3.125 \\times 10^{19}$</katex>."
