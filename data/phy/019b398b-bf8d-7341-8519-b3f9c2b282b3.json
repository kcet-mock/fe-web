  "question": [
    "An induced current of 2 A flows through a coil. The resistance of the coil is 10 Ω. What is the change in magnetic flux associated with the coil in 1 ms?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "0.2 × 10⁻² Wb"
    ],
    [
      "2 × 10⁻² Wb"
    ],
    [
      "22 × 10⁻² Wb"
    ],
    [
      "0.22 × 10⁻² Wb"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Induced EMF ε = I × R = 2 A × 10 Ω = 20 V.",
    "From Faraday's law, magnitude of EMF | ε | = dΦ/dt.",
    "Therefore, dΦ = ε × dt = 20 V × 10⁻³ s = 0.02 Wb = 2 × 10⁻² Wb."
