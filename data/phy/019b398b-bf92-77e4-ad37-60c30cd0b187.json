  "question": [
    "Water flows through a horizontal pipe of varying cross-section at a rate of 0.314 m³s⁻¹. The velocity of water at a point where the radius of the pipe is 10 cm is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "0.1 ms⁻¹"
    ],
    [
      "1 ms⁻¹"
    ],
    [
      "10 ms⁻¹"
    ],
    [
      "100 ms⁻¹"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Flow rate Q = A × v = 0.314.",
    "Area A = πr² = 3.14 × (0.1)² = 0.0314 m².",
    "v = Q / A = 0.314 / 0.0314 = 10 ms⁻¹."
  ]
