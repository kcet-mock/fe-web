  "question": [
    "In series LCR circuit at resonance, the phase difference between voltage and current is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "<katex>$\\frac{\\pi}{4}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$\\frac{\\pi}{2}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "Zero"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$\\pi$</katex>"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "At resonance, the inductive reactance equals capacitive reactance (<katex>$X_L = X_C$</katex>). The circuit behaves as a purely resistive circuit, so voltage and current are in phase (phase difference is zero)."
