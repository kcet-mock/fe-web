  "question": [
    "A metallic sphere of radius R carrying a charge q is kept at certain distance from another metallic sphere of radius R/4 carrying a charge Q. What is the electric flux at any point inside the metallic sphere of radius R due to the sphere of radius R/4?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "q/ε₀"
    ],
    [
      "Zero"
    ],
    [
      "Q/ε₀"
    ],
    [
      "(q+Q)/ε₀"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Since the spheres are metallic (conductors), the electric field inside the material of the conductor is zero.",
    "Also, due to electrostatic shielding, the field/flux inside the conductor from external charges is zero.",
    "[cite: 255, 281]"
