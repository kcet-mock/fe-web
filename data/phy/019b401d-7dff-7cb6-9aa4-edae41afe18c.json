  "question": [
    "For a given electric current the drift velocity of conduction electrons in a copper wire is v and their mobility is $\\mu$. When the current is increased at constant temperature"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "$v_d$ decreases, $\\mu$ remains the same"
    ],
    [
      "$v_d$ remains the same, $\\mu$ decreases"
    ],
    [
      "$v_d$ increases, $\\mu$ remains the same"
    ],
    [
      "$v_d$ remains the same, $\\mu$ increases"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Mobility $\\mu$ depends on temperature (relaxation time), so it remains constant. Drift velocity $v_d \\propto I$, so it increases."
