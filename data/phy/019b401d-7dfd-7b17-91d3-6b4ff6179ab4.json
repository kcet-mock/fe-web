  "question": [
    "100 g of ice at $0^{\\circ}C$ is mixed with 100 g of water at $100^{\\circ}C$. The final temperature of the mixture is [Take $L_{f}=3.36\\times10^{5}J~kg^{-1}$ and $S_{w}=4.2\\times10^{3}J~kg^{-1}k^{-1}]$"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "$50^{\\circ}C$"
    ],
    [
      "$1^{\\circ}C$"

    [
      "$40^{\\circ}C$"
    ],
    [
      "$10^{\\circ}C$"
    ]

  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Heat to melt 100g ice: 33600 J. Heat from 100g water cooling to 0: 42000 J.",
    "Excess heat = 8400 J. Total mass 200g.",
    "$\\Delta T = \\frac{8400}{0.2 \\times 4200} = 10^{\\circ}C$."
