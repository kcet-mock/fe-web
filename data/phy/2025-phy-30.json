    "Two similar galvanometers are converted into an ammeter and a milliammeter. The shunt resistance of ammeter as compared to the shunt resistance of milliammeter will be"

  "choices": [
    [
      "Zero"
    ],
    [
      "More"

    [
      "Less"

    [
      "Equal"

  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Shunt resistance <katex>$S = \\frac{I_g G}{I - I_g}$</katex>.",
    "For an Ammeter, the range I is large (e.g., 1A). For a milliammeter, I is small (e.g., 1mA).",
    "Since S is inversely proportional to I (approximately), a larger range requires a smaller shunt.",
    "Therefore, Ammeter (higher range) has less shunt resistance than Milliammeter."
