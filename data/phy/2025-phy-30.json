  "question": [
    "Two similar galvanometers are converted into an ammeter and a milliammeter. The shunt resistance of ammeter as compared to the shunt resistance of milliammeter will be"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Zero"
    ],
    [
      "More"
    ],
    [
      "Less"
    ],
    [
      "Equal"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "An ammeter measures larger currents than a milliammeter.",
    "To measure larger current, more current must bypass the galvanometer, requiring a smaller shunt resistance.",
    "Therefore, the ammeter shunt is less."
