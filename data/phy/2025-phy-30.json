    "Two similar galvanometers are converted into an ammeter and a milliammeter. The shunt resistance of ammeter as compared to the shunt resistance of milliammeter will be"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Zero"
    ],
    [
      "More"
    ],
    [
      "Less"
    ],
    [
      "Equal"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "<katex>$i = i_g(\\frac{G}{S} + 1)$</katex>. [cite: 500]",
    "More 'i', less S. [cite: 501]",
    "Ammeter measures more current than milliammeter, so it will have Less shunt resistance. [cite: 502]"
