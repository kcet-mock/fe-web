  "question": [
    "The angle between the particle velocity and wave velocity in a transverse wave is [except when the particle passes through the mean position]"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "<katex>$\\frac{\\pi}{4}$</katex> radian"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$\\frac{\\pi}{2}$</katex> radian"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$\\pi$</katex> radian"
    ],
    [
      "Zero radian"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "In a transverse wave, particles oscillate perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave. [cite: 253]",
    "Hence angle is <katex>$\\frac{\\pi}{2}$</katex> radian. [cite: 254]"
