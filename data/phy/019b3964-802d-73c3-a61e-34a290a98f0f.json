  "question": [
    "During an elastic collision between two bodies, which of the following statements are correct?",
    "I. The initial kinetic energy is equal to the final kinetic energy of the system.",
    "II. The linear momentum is conserved.",
    "III. The kinetic energy during Δt (the collision time) is not conserved."
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "II and III only"
    ],
    [
      "I and III only"
    ],
    [
      "I, II and III"
    ],
    [
      "I and II only"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "In an elastic collision:",
    "I. Total kinetic energy is conserved (Initial KE = Final KE).",
    "II. Linear momentum is always conserved.",
    "III. During the brief collision time, some kinetic energy is converted to potential energy of deformation, so KE is not conserved instantaneously.",
    "All statements are correct.",
