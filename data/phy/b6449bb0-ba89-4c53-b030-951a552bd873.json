    "A block of certain mass is placed on a rough floor. The coefficients of static and kinetic friction between the block and the floor are 0.4 and 0.25 respectively. A constant horizontal force <katex>$F=20$</katex> N acts on it so that the velocity of the block varies with time according to the following graph. The mass of the block is nearly (Take <katex>$g=10 \\text{ ms}^{-2}$</katex>)",

    "From the graph, acceleration <katex>$a = \\frac{v-u}{t} = \\frac{20-0}{3} = \\frac{20}{3} \\text{ m/s}^2$</katex>.",
    "Since the block is moving, kinetic friction acts on it.",
