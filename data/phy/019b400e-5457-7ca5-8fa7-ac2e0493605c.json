  "question": [
    "A gas is taken from state A to state B along two different paths 1 and 2. The heat absorbed and work done by the system along these two paths are $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ and $W_{1}$ and $W_{2}$ respectively. Then"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "$W_{1}=W_{2}$"
    ],
    [
      "$Q_{1}-W_{1}=Q_{2}-W_{2}$"
    ],
    [
      "$Q_{1}+W_{1}=Q_{2}+W_{2}$"
    ],
    [
      "$Q_{1}=Q_{2}$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "According to the First Law of Thermodynamics, $\\Delta U = Q - W$.",
    "Since internal energy $U$ is a state function, $\\Delta U$ depends only on initial and final states (A and B).",
    "Thus, $\\Delta U_1 = \\Delta U_2$, which implies $Q_1 - W_1 = Q_2 - W_2$."
