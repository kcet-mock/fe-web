  "question": [
    "A square loop of side 2 cm enters a magnetic field with a constant speed of $2cm~s^{-1}$ as shown. The front edge enters the field at $t=0s.$ Which of the following graph correctly depicts the induced emf in the loop? (Take clockwise direction positive)",

  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Graph A"
    ],
    [
      "Graph B (Negative pulse then Positive pulse)"
    ],
    [
      "Graph C"
    ],
    [
      "Graph D"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "As the loop enters, flux increases inwards, inducing counter-clockwise current (negative emf).",
    "While completely inside, flux is constant, emf is zero.",
    "As it leaves, flux decreases, inducing clockwise current (positive emf)."
