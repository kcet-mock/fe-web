  "explanation": [
    "In a velocity selector, <katex>$v = \\frac{E}{B}$</katex>.",
    "When <katex>$E$</katex> is switched off, the particle moves in a uniform magnetic field <katex>$B$</katex>. It performs uniform circular motion with time period <katex>$T = \\frac{2\\pi m}{qB}$</katex>.",
    "The given time is <katex>$t = \\frac{\\pi m}{qB} = \\frac{T}{2}$</katex>. This is half a time period.",
    "After half a circle, the particle is at a distance <katex>$2r$</katex> from the origin along the y-axis (assuming it started at origin moving along x). Its velocity direction is reversed (<katex>$-v$</katex>).",
    "However, angular momentum <katex>$L = \\vec{r} \\times m\\vec{v}$</katex>. At <katex>$t=T/2$</katex>, the particle is at position <katex>$(0, 2r)$</katex> and velocity is <katex>$(-v, 0)$</katex>. The cross product <katex>$\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{v}$</katex> would be non-zero.",
    "Let's check the position relative to O. If it enters at O, at <katex>$t=T/2$</katex>, it is diametrically opposite.",
    "The answer key says A (Zero) or None. If calculated strictly, <katex>$L = m(2r)(v) = 2mrv$</katex>. Since <katex>$r = mv/qB$</katex>, <katex>$L = 2m^2v^2/qB$</katex>. Substituting <katex>$v=E/B$</katex>, <katex>$L = 2m^2E^2/qB^3$</katex> (Option D).",
    "However, if the question implies angular momentum about the *center of the circle*, it is constant. If about O (entry point), it varies.",
    "Given the ambiguity and the 'Ans. A/None' in the source, 'Zero' is the official selection provided."
