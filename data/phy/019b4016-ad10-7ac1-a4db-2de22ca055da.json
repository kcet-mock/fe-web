  "question": [
    "A motor-cyclist moving towards a huge cliff with a speed of $18~kmh^{-1}$, blows a horn of source frequency 325 Hz. If the speed of the sound in air is $330~ms^{-1}$, the number of beats heard by him is"

  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Beat frequency $\\Delta f = f_0 \\frac{2v_s}{v - v_s}$.",
    "$v_s = 18 km/h = 5 m/s$.",
    "$\\Delta f = 325 \\times \\frac{10}{325} = 10$ Hz."
