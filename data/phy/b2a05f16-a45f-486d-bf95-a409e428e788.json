  "question": [
    "The figure shows variation of R, <katex>$X_{L}$</katex> and <katex>$X_{C}$</katex> with frequency 'f' in a series LCR circuit. Then for what frequency point is the circuit capacitive?",

  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "A series LCR circuit is capacitive when <katex>$X_C > X_L$</katex>.",
    "<katex>$X_C \\propto 1/f$</katex> decreases with frequency, while <katex>$X_L \\propto f$</katex> increases with frequency.",
    "Therefore, the circuit is capacitive at lower frequencies (before resonance).",
    "Point A is at a frequency lower than the intersection (resonance point B), so the circuit is capacitive at A."
