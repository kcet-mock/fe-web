  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "X copper, Y - semiconductor, Z - nichrome"
    ],
    [
      "X-semiconductor, Y-nichrome, Z copper"
    ],
    [
      "X-nichrome, Y copper, Z - semiconductor"
    ],
    [
      "X copper, Y - nichrome, Z - semiconductor"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "X increases linearly/parabolically with T (typical of metals like Copper).",
    "Y increases linearly but slowly with T (typical of alloys like Nichrome).",
    "Z decreases with T (typical of semiconductors)."
