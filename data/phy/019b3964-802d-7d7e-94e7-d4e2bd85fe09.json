  "question": [
    "If rₚ, vₚ, Lₚ and rₐ, vₐ, Lₐ are radii, velocities and angular momenta of a planet at perihelion and aphelion of its elliptical orbit around the Sun respectively, then"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "rₚ > rₐ, vₚ > vₐ, Lₚ > Lₐ"
    ],
    [
      "rₚ < rₐ, vₚ > vₐ, Lₐ = Lₚ"
    ],
    [
      "rₚ > rₐ, vₚ < vₐ, Lₐ = Lₚ"
    ],
    [
      "rₚ < rₐ, vₚ < vₐ, Lₐ < Lₚ"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Angular momentum is conserved, so Lₚ = Lₐ.",
    "Perihelion is the closest point, so rₚ < rₐ.",
    "From conservation of angular momentum (mvr = constant), since rₚ < rₐ, vₚ must be > vₐ.",
