  "question": [
    "Which of the following graphs represents the variation of magnetic field B with perpendicular distance ‘r’ from an infinitely long, straight conductor carrying current?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Graph 1: Linear increasing"
    ],
    [
      "Graph 2: Rectangular hyperbola (decreasing)"
    ],
    [
      "Graph 3: Curve increasing then decreasing"
    ],
    [
      "Graph 4: Linear decreasing"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "For an infinitely long straight conductor, B = μ₀I / 2πr.",
    "B ∝ 1/r.",
    "The graph is a rectangular hyperbola.",
    "[cite: 459, 463]"
