  "question": [
    "If we consider an electron and a photon of same de-Broglie wavelength, then they will have same"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Angular momentum"
    ],
    [
      "Energy"
    ],
    [
      "Velocity"
    ],
    [
      "Momentum"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "de-Broglie wavelength $\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p}$.",
    "If $\\lambda$ is the same, then momentum $p$ must be the same."
