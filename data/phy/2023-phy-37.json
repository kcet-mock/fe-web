  "question": [
    "A particle is in uniform circular motion. Related to one complete revolution of the particle, which among the statements is correct?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Average speed of the particle is zero"
    ],
    [
      "Average velocity of the particle is zero"
    ],
    [
      "Average acceleration of the particle is zero"
    ],
    [
      "Displacement of the particle is zero"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Note: The provided answer key is A. However, physically, for one complete revolution: Average speed is non-zero (circumference/time). Average velocity is zero (displacement is zero). Displacement is zero. Average acceleration is zero (integral of vector change over period is zero). Option A seems incorrect as a true statement, but B, C, D are candidates. B and D are physically correct. Following source key A."
