  "question": [
    "Which of the following combinations should be selected for better tuning of an LCR circuit used for communication?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "R = 20 Ω, L = 1.5 H, C = 35 μF"
    ],
    [
      "R = 25 Ω, L = 2.5 H, C = 45 μF"
    ],
    [
      "R = 25 Ω, L = 1.5 H, C = 45 μF"
    ],
    [
      "R = 15 Ω, L = 3.5 H, C = 30 μF"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "For better tuning (sharp resonance), the Quality Factor (Q-factor) should be high.",
    "Q = (1/R) √(L/C).",
    "To maximize Q, we need low R, high L, and low C.",
    "Option (D) has the lowest Resistance (15 Ω) and the highest Inductance (3.5 H) with low Capacitance, yielding the highest Q-factor."
