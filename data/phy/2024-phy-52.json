    "In an experiment to determine the temperature coefficient of resistance of a conductor, a coil of wire X is immersed in a liquid. It is heated by an external agent. A meter bridge set up is used to determine resistance of the coil X at different temperatures. The balancing points measured at temperatures <katex>$t_{1}=0^{\\circ}C$</katex> and <katex>$t_{2}=100^{\\circ}C$</katex> are 50 cm and 60 cm respectively. If the standard resistance taken out is <katex>$S=4~\\Omega$</katex> in both trials, the temperature coefficient of the coil is",

    "At 0°C: <katex>$X_0/4 = 50/50 \\implies X_0 = 4$</katex>.",
    "At 100°C: <katex>$X_{100}/4 = 60/40 = 1.5 \\implies X_{100} = 6$</katex>.",
    "<katex>$6 = 4(1 + \\alpha \\times 100)$</katex>.",
    "<katex>$1.5 = 1 + 100\\alpha \\implies \\alpha = 0.5/100 = 0.005$</katex>."
