  "question": [
    "A block of mass m is connected to a light spring of force constant k. The system is placed inside a damping medium of damping constant b. The instantaneous values of displacement, acceleration and energy of the block are x, a and E respectively. The initial amplitude of oscillation is A and <katex>$\\Theta^{\\prime}$</katex> is the angular frequency of oscillations. The incorrect expression related to the damped oscillation is"

  "choices": [
    [
      "<katex>$E=\\frac{1}{2}kA^{2}e^{\\frac{bt}{m}}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$m\\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}+b\\frac{dx}{dt}+kx=0$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$x=Ae^{\\frac{b}{m}}cos(\\omega^{\\prime}t+\\phi)$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$\\omega^{\\prime}=\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}-\\frac{b^{2}}{4m^{2}}}$</katex>"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "The damping term in the exponent should be <katex>$-bt/2m$</katex> for amplitude. The energy decay is <katex>$-bt/m$</katex>. Option C has <katex>$b/m$</katex> (positive and wrong factor) in exponent. Also A has positive exponent which implies growth, but C is definitely wrong form."
