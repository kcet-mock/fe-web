  "question": [
    "Electromagnetic waves are incident normally on a perfectly reflecting surface having surface area A. If I is the intensity of the incident electromagnetic radiation and c is the speed of light in vacuum, the force exerted by the electromagnetic wave on the reflecting surface is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "$\\frac{2IA}{c}$"
    ],
    [
      "$\\frac{IA}{c}$"
    ],
    [
      "$\\frac{IA}{2c}$"
    ],
    [
      "$\\frac{1}{2Ac}$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "For a perfectly reflecting surface, the change in momentum is double that of absorption.",
    "Pressure $P_{rad} = 2I/c$.",
    "Force $F = P_{rad} \\times A = \\frac{2IA}{c}$."
