  "question": [
    "A closed water tank has cross-sectional area A. It has a small hole at a depth of h from the free surface of water. The radius of the hole is r so that $r\\ll\\sqrt{\\frac{A}{\\pi}}$. If $P_{o}$ is the pressure inside the tank above water level, and $P_{a}$ is the atmospheric pressure, the rate of flow of the water coming out of the hole is [p is the density of water]",

    "Using Bernoulli's equation with pressure difference: Efflux velocity $v = \\sqrt{2gh + \\frac{2(P_0-P_a)}{\\rho}}$.",
    "Flow rate $Q = Av = \\pi r^2 v$."
