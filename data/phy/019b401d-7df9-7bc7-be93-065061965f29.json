  "question": [
    "The current in a coil changes from 2A to 5A in 0.3s. The magnitude of emf induced in the coil is 1.0V. The value of self-inductance of the coil is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "0.1mH"
    ],
    [
      "10mH"
    ],
    [
      "1.0mH"
    ],
    [
      "100mH"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "$|\\varepsilon| = L \\frac{dI}{dt} \\Rightarrow 1.0 = L \\frac{5-2}{0.3}$.",
    "$1.0 = L (10) \\Rightarrow L = 0.1 H = 100 mH$."
