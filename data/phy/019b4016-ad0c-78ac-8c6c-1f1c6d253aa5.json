  "question": [
    "The figure shows variation of R, $X_{L}$ and $X_{C}$ with frequency 'f' in a series LCR circuit. Then for what frequency point is the circuit capacitive?",

  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "The circuit is capacitive when capacitive reactance $X_C > X_L$.",
    "In the graph, $X_C$ is the decreasing curve and $X_L$ is the increasing line.",
    "$X_C > X_L$ occurs at lower frequencies, to the left of the intersection (resonance).",
    "Point A represents this region."
