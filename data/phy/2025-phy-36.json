  "choices": [
    [
      "Deflects towards <katex>$X^1$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "Does not deflect"
    ],
    [
      "Oscillates"
    ],
    [
      "Deflects towards X"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "According to Lenz's law, it should oppose the change in flux. Pulling away causes opposite deflection. Deflects towards <katex>$X^1$</katex>. [cite: 570]"
