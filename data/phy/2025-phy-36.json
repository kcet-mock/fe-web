  "choices": [
    [
      "Deflects towards <katex>$X^1$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "Does not deflect"

    [
      "Oscillates"
    ],
    [
      "Deflects towards X"
    ]

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "According to Lenz's law, the induced current opposes the change.",
    "Pushing N-pole in induces one direction (deflection X).",
    "Pulling N-pole out induces the opposite direction (deflection X')."
