    "A square loop of side length 'a' is moving away from an infinitely long current carrying conductor at a constant speed 'v' as shown. Let 'x' be the instantaneous distance between the long conductor and side AB. The mutual inductance (M) of the square loop - long conductor pair changes with time (t) according to which of the following graphs?",

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "The magnetic field due to the long wire varies as <katex>$B \\propto \\frac{1}{x}$</katex>. Since <katex>$x = vt$</katex>, the flux <katex>$\\phi \\propto \\frac{1}{vt}$</katex> (approximately).",
    "Mutual inductance <katex>$M = \\frac{\\phi}{I}$</katex>, so M decreases non-linearly with time as the loop moves away.",
    "Graph A represents a rectangular hyperbola type decrease <katex>$M \\propto \\frac{1}{t}$</katex>."
