    "Total turns $N = 5 \\times 1000 = 5000$. Length $L = 1$m.",
    "Turn density $n = N/L = 5000$.",
    "$B = \\mu_0 n I = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7} \\times 5000 \\times 7$",
    "$B = 20000\\pi \\times 7 \\times 10^{-7} = 14\\pi \\times 10^{-3}$",
    "$B = 14 \\times 3.14159 \\times 10^{-3} \\approx 43.98 \\times 10^{-3} = 4.39 \\times 10^{-2}$T.",
    "Note: The options seem to be formatted with missing powers in the text extraction, but option 2 (closest to 4.4 x 10^-2) is the standard answer derived from these values in similar problem sets."
