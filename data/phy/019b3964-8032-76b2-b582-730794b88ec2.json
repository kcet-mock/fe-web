  "question": [
    "Which of the following expression can be deduced on the basis of dimensional analysis? (All symbols have their usual meanings)"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "x = A cos ωt"
    ],
    [
      "N = N₀ e⁻λt"
    ],
    [
      "F = 6πηrv"
    ],
    [
      "s = ut + at²"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "F = 6πηrv (Stokes' Law) is a relation typically derived/deduced using dimensional analysis (checking dependence on η, r, v).",
    "Note: s = ut + 1/2 at² is dimensionally correct but missing the 1/2 factor in the option, making it an example of a formula where dimensional analysis cannot determine constants.",
