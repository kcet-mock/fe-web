    "Which of the following expression can be deduced on the basis of dimensional analysis? (All symbols have their usual meanings)"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "<katex>$x = A \\cos \\omega t$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$N = N_0 e^{-\\lambda t}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$F = 6\\pi\\eta rv$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$s = ut + \\frac{1}{2}at^2$</katex>"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Dimensional analysis can typically deduce product relations like <katex>$F = 6\\pi\\eta rv$</katex> (Stokes' law) up to a constant. [cite: 861]"
