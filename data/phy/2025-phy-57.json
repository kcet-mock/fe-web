  "question": [
    "Which of the following expression can be deduced on the basis of dimensional analysis? (All symbols have their usual meanings)"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "<katex>$x = A \\cos \\omega t$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$N = N_0 e^{-\\lambda t}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$F = 6\\pi \\eta r v$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$s = ut + \\frac{1}{2}at^2$</katex>"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Stoke's law (<katex>$F = 6\\pi \\eta r v$</katex>) is a classic example of a formula derived using dimensional analysis by checking dependencies on viscosity, radius, and velocity."
