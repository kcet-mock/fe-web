  "question": [
    "Which of the following expression can be deduced on the basis of dimensional analysis? (All symbols have their usual meanings)"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "<katex>$x = A \\cos \\omega t$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$N = N_0 e^{-\\lambda t}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$F = 6\\pi\\eta rv$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$s = ut + \\frac{1}{2}at^2$</katex>"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Dimensional analysis cannot determine dimensionless constants like <katex>$\\cos, e, \\frac{1}{2}$</katex> etc.",
    "Only the form of dependencies like <katex>$F \\propto \\eta r v$</katex> can be derived. The constant <katex>$6\\pi$</katex> is experimental.",
    "However, among options, relations involving transcendental functions (cos, exp) or sums cannot be fully derived strictly from dimensions alone without knowing the structure. Stokes law is often cited as a classic example of dimensional derivation (excluding the constant)."
