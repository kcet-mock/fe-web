  "question": [
    "Two thin long parallel wires separated by a distance 'r' from each other in vacuum carry a current of I ampere in opposite directions. Then, they will"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Attract each other with a force per unit length of $\\frac{\\mu_0 I^2}{2\\pi r}$"
    ],
    [
      "Repel each other with a force per unit length of $\\frac{\\mu_0 I^2}{2\\pi r}$"
    ],
    [
      "Repel each other with a force per unit length of $\\frac{\\mu_0 I^2}{2r^2}$"
    ],
    [
      "Attract each other with a force per unit length of $\\frac{\\mu_0 I^2}{2\\pi r^2}$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Parallel wires carrying current in opposite directions repel each other.",
    "The magnitude of force per unit length is $F/l = \\frac{\\mu_0 I_1 I_2}{2\\pi r} = \\frac{\\mu_0 I^2}{2\\pi r}$."
