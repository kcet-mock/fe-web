  "question": [
    "Light of energy E falls normally on a metal of work function E/3. The kinetic energies (K) of the photo electrons are"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "K = 2E/3"
    ],
    [
      "K = E/3"
    ],
    [
      "0 ≤ K ≤ 2E/3"
    ],
    [
      "0 ≤ K ≤ E/3"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Max kinetic energy K_max = E - Work Function = E - E/3 = 2E/3.",
    "Photoelectrons are emitted with a range of kinetic energies from 0 up to K_max.",
    "Thus, 0 ≤ K ≤ 2E/3."
