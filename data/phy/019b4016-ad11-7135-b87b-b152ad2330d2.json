    "A coil having 9 turns carrying a current produces magnetic field $B_1$ at the centre. Now the coil is rewounded into 3 turns carrying same current. Then the magnetic field at the centre $B_2$ ="
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "$B_1/9$"
    ],
    [
      "$9B_1$"

    ],
    [
      "$B_1/3$"

  "explanation": [
    "Length $L$ is constant. $N_1 \\cdot 2\\pi R_1 = N_2 \\cdot 2\\pi R_2$.",
    "$9 R_1 = 3 R_2 \\Rightarrow R_2 = 3R_1$.",
    "$B \\propto N/R$. Ratio $B_2/B_1 = (N_2/R_2) / (N_1/R_1) = (3/3R_1) / (9/R_1) = (1/R_1) / (9/R_1) = 1/9$."
