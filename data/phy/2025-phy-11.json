    "Let junction temp be <katex>$T_x$</katex>.",
    "Heat flows from higher temp to lower temp. Sum of heat currents meeting at junction is zero.",
    "Currents from the two <katex>$90^{\\circ}C$</katex> ends flow to <katex>$T_x$</katex>, and from <katex>$T_x$</katex> to <katex>$0^{\\circ}C$</katex>.",
    "<katex>$\\frac{K A(90-T_x)}{L} + \\frac{K A(90-T_x)}{L} = \\frac{K A(T_x-0)}{L}$</katex>",
    "<katex>$2(90-T_x) = T_x \\Rightarrow 180 - 2T_x = T_x \\Rightarrow 3T_x = 180 \\Rightarrow T_x = 60^{\\circ}C$</katex>."
