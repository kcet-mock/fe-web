    "Let junction temperature be <katex>$T_x$</katex>.",
    "Current conservation at junction: <katex>$H_{in} = H_{out}$</katex> or net current leaving is zero.",
    "<katex>$\\frac{T_x - 0}{R} + \\frac{T_x - 90}{R} + \\frac{T_x - 90}{R} = 0$</katex> (Assuming currents leave x)",

    "<katex>$180 - 2T_x = T_x$</katex>",
    "<katex>$3T_x = 180 \\Rightarrow T_x = 60^{\\circ}C$</katex>."
