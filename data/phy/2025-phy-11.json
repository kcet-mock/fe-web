    "Let the temperature of the junction be <katex>$T_x$</katex>. [cite: 195]",
    "Heat current <katex>$H = H_1 + H_2$</katex> assuming flow direction towards lower temp, or simply sum of currents leaving/entering. [cite: 195]",
    "Equation: <katex>$\\frac{T_x - 0}{R} = \\frac{90 - T_x}{R} + \\frac{90 - T_x}{R}$</katex> (assuming heat flows from 90 to x, and x to 0). [cite: 196]",
    "<katex>$T_x = 90 - T_x + 90 - T_x$</katex>",
    "<katex>$3T_x = 180$</katex> [cite: 197]",
