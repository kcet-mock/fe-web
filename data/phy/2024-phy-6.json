    [
      "<katex>$\\frac{2IA}{c}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$\\frac{IA}{c}$</katex>"

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "The radiation pressure exerted by an electromagnetic wave on a perfectly reflecting surface is <katex>$P = \\frac{2I}{c}$</katex>.",
    "The force is Pressure <katex>$\\times$</katex> Area: <katex>$F = P \\times A = \\frac{2IA}{c}$</katex>."
