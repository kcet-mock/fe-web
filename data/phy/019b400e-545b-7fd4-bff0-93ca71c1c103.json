    "A series LCR circuit containing an AC source of 100V has an inductor and a capacitor of reactances 24$\\Omega$ and 16$\\Omega$ respectively. If a resistance of 6$\\Omega$ is connected in series, then the potential difference across the series combination of inductor and capacitor only is",

  "explanation": [
    "Impedance $Z = \\sqrt{R^2 + (X_L - X_C)^2} = \\sqrt{6^2 + (24-16)^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 64} = 10 \\Omega$.",
    "Current $I = V/Z = 100/10 = 10$ A.",
    "Voltage across LC combination: $V_{LC} = I(X_L - X_C)$ (or $I Z_{LC}$).",
    "$V_{LC} = 10 \\times (24 - 16) = 10 \\times 8 = 80$ V."
