  "question": [
    "A block of certain mass is placed on a rough floor. The coefficients of static and kinetic friction between the block and the floor are 0.4 and 0.25 respectively. A constant horizontal force <katex>$F=20$</katex> N acts on it so that the velocity of the block varies with time according to the following graph. The mass of the block is nearly (Take <katex>$g=10\\text{ ms}^{-2}$</katex>)",

  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "From the graph, acceleration <katex>$a = \\text{slope} = \\frac{20-0}{3-0} = \\frac{20}{3} \\text{ ms}^{-2}$</katex>.",
    "The equation of motion is <katex>$F - f_k = ma$</katex>, where <katex>$f_k = \\mu_k mg$</katex>.",
    "<katex>$20 - 0.25 \\times m \\times 10 = m \\times \\frac{20}{3}$</katex>.",
    "<katex>$20 - 2.5m = 6.67m \\implies 20 = 9.17m \\implies m \\approx 2.18 \\text{ kg}$</katex>."
