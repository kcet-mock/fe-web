    "For a particle executing simple harmonic motion (SHM), at its mean position"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Velocity is zero and acceleration is maximum"
    ],
    [
      "Velocity is maximum and acceleration is zero"
    ],
    [
      "Both velocity and acceleration are maximum"
    ],
    [
      "Both velocity and acceleration are zero"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "At mean position (<katex>$x=0$</katex>), velocity is maximum (<katex>$v = \\omega A$</katex>) and acceleration is zero (<katex>$a = \\omega^2 x = 0$</katex>)."
