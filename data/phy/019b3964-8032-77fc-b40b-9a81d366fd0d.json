  "question": [
    "A particle is in uniform circular motion. The equation of its trajectory is given by (x - 2)² + y² = 25, where x and y are in meter. The speed of the particle is 2ms⁻¹. When the particle attains the lowest ‘y’ co-ordinate, the acceleration of the particle is (in ms⁻²)"

  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Trajectory is a circle with center (2,0) and radius 5m.",
    "Lowest y-coordinate is at (2, -5).",
    "Centripetal acceleration is directed towards the center (2,0).",
    "Vector from (2,-5) to (2,0) is in +y direction (j).",
    "Magnitude a = v²/R = 2²/5 = 4/5 = 0.8 m/s².",
    "Acceleration vector = 0.8j.",
