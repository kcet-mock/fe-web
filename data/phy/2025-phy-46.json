  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "When a plane wavefront enters a denser medium (<katex>$n_2 > n_1$</katex>) through a convex lens, the central part travels through the thickest part of the lens and is slowed down the most. The edges travel through thinner parts.",
    "This causes the wavefront to converge/become spherical converging towards a focus. The shape becomes concave (converging)."
