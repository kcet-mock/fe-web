  "question": [
    "Electromagnetic waves are incident normally on a perfectly reflecting surface having surface area A. If I is the intensity of the incident electromagnetic radiation and c is the speed of light in vacuum, the force exerted by the electromagnetic wave on the reflecting surface is"

    [
      "<katex>$\\frac{2IA}{c}$</katex>"
    ],
    [

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "For a perfectly reflecting surface, the change in momentum is double that of an absorbing surface.",
    "Force <katex>$F = \\frac{\\Delta p}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{Energy}}{c \\Delta t} = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{Power}}{c} = \\frac{2IA}{c}$</katex>."
