  "choices": [
    [
      "<katex>$2 \\mu F$</katex>"
    ],

  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "This is a balanced Wheatstone bridge of capacitors (ratio 1:1 = 1:1).",
    "The central capacitor is ineffective.",
    "The circuit reduces to two series branches in parallel.",
    "Branch 1 (top): 1 and 1 in series = 0.5.",
    "Branch 2 (bottom): 1 and 1 in series = 0.5.",
    "Total: <katex>$0.5 + 0.5 = 1 \\mu F$</katex>."
