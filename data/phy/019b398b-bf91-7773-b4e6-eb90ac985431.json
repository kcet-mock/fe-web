  "question": [
    "An athlete runs along a circular track of diameter 80 m. The distance travelled and the magnitude of displacement of the athlete when he covers 3/4 of the circle is (in m)"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "60π, 40√2"
    ],
    [
      "40π, 60√2"
    ],
    [
      "120π, 80√2"
    ],
    [
      "80π, 120√2"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Radius R = 40 m. Distance = (3/4) × 2πR = 60π m.",
    "Displacement for 3/4 circle is the chord connecting ends of a 90° arc = √(R² + R²) = R√2 = 40√2 m."
