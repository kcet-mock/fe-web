  "question": [
    "A coil having 9 turns carrying a current produces magnetic field B₁ at the centre. Now the coil is rewounded into 3 turns carrying same current. Then the magnetic field at the centre B₂ = ____"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "B₁ / 9"
    ],
    [
      "9 B₁"
    ],
    [
      "3 B₁"
    ],
    [
      "B₁ / 3"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "B ∝ N² for a coil rewound from the same length of wire.",
    "B₂/B₁ = (N₂/N₁)² = (3/9)² = (1/3)² = 1/9."
  ]
