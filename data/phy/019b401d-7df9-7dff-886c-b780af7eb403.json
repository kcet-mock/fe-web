  "question": [
    "An equiconvex lens made of glass of refractive index $\\frac{3}{2}$ has focal length f in air. It is completely immersed in water of refractive index $\\frac{4}{3}$. The percentage change in the focal length is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "400% decrease"
    ],
    [
      "300% increase"
    ],
    [
      "400% increase"
    ],
    [
      "300% decrease"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Focal length in water becomes 4 times the focal length in air for these refractive indices.",
    "Change is $4f - f = 3f$. Percentage increase = $(3f/f) \\times 100\\% = 300\\%$."
