  "question": [
    "In an experiment to determine the temperature coefficient of resistance of a conductor, a coil of wire X is immersed in a liquid. A meter bridge set up is used to determine resistance of the coil X at different temperatures. The balancing points measured at temperatures $t_1 = 0^{\\circ}C$ and $t_2 = 100^{\\circ}C$ are 50 cm and 60 cm respectively. If the standard resistance taken out is S = 4 Ω in both trials, the temperature coefficient of the coil is",

    "At 0°C: $X_0/S = 50/50 \\Rightarrow X_0 = 4\\Omega$.",
    "At 100°C: $X_{100}/S = 60/40 \\Rightarrow X_{100} = 6\\Omega$.",
    "$\\Delta R = R_0 \\alpha \\Delta T \\Rightarrow 2 = 4 \\alpha (100) \\Rightarrow \\alpha = 0.005$."
