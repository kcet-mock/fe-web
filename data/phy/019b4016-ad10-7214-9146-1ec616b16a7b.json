    "For a particle executing simple harmonic motion (SHM), at its mean position"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Velocity is zero and acceleration is maximum"
    ],
    [
      "Velocity is maximum and acceleration is zero"
    ],
    [
      "Both velocity and acceleration are maximum"
    ],
    [
      "Both velocity and acceleration are zero"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "At the mean position ($x=0$), the restoring force and acceleration are zero.",
    "The velocity is at its maximum value ($v_{max} = A\\omega$)."
