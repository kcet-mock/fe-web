  "question": [
    "A particle of specific charge π C/kg is projected from the origin towards positive x-axis with the velocity 10 ms⁻¹ in a uniform magnetic field B = -2k T. The velocity v of particle after time 1/12 s will be (in ms⁻¹)"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "5(i + j)"
    ],
    [
      "5(i + √3j)"
    ],
    [
      "5(√3i - j)"
    ],
    [
      "5(√3i + j)"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Angular frequency ω = qB/m = π × 2 = 2π rad/s.",
    "Angle rotated θ = ωt = 2π × (1/12) = π/6 = 30°.",
    "Velocity vector rotates 30° towards y-axis (Force q(v×B) is +y).",
    "v = 10(cos 30° i + sin 30° j) = 10(√3/2 i + 1/2 j) = 5√3 i + 5 j."
  ]
