  "question": [
    "In alpha particle scattering experiment, if v is the initial velocity of the particle, then the distance of closest approach is d. If the velocity is doubled, then the distance of closest approach becomes"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "4d"
    ],
    [
      "2d"
    ],
    [
      "d/2"
    ],
    [
      "d/4"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Distance of closest approach d is inversely proportional to kinetic energy (d ∝ 1/K).",
    "K ∝ v², so d ∝ 1/v².",
    "If v is doubled (2v), v² becomes 4v², so d becomes d/4."
