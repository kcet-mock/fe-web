  "question": [
    "The torque acting on a magnetic dipole placed in uniform magnetic field is zero, when the angle between the dipole axis and the magnetic field is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "katex:$60^{\\circ}$"
    ],
    [
      "katex:$90^{\\circ}$"

    [
      "Zero"
    ],
    [
      "katex:$45^{\\circ}$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "The torque on a magnetic dipole is given by $\\tau = MB \\sin \\theta$.",
    "For the torque to be zero, $\\sin \\theta = 0$, which implies $\\theta = 0^{\\circ}$ or $180^{\\circ}$."
