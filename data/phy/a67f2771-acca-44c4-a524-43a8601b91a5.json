  "question": [
    "You are given a dipole of charge +q and -q separated by a distance 2R. A sphere 'A' of radius 'R' passes through the centre of the dipole as shown below and another sphere 'B' of radius '2R' passes through the charge +q. Then the electric flux through the sphere A is",

    [
      "<katex>$q/\\epsilon_0$</katex>"

    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "From the description/diagram, sphere A (radius R, passing through center of dipole where separation is 2R) encloses one of the charges. Typically, if drawn symmetrically, it encloses the -q charge.",
    "According to Gauss's Law, Flux <katex>$\\phi = \\frac{q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_0} = \\frac{-q}{\\epsilon_0}$</katex>."
