    "A closed water tank has cross-sectional area A. It has a small hole at a depth of h from the free surface of water. The radius of the hole is r so that <katex>$r\\ll\\sqrt{\\frac{A}{\\pi}}$</katex>. If <katex>$P_{o}$</katex> is the pressure inside the tank above water level, and <katex>$P_{a}$</katex> is the atmospheric pressure, the rate of flow of the water coming out of the hole is [<katex>$\\rho$</katex> is the density of water]",
