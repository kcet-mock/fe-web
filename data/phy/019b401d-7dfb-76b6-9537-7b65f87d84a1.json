  "question": [
    "An unpolarised light of intensity I is passed through two polaroids kept one after the other with their planes parallel to each other. The intensity of light emerging from second polaroid is $\\frac{I}{4}$. The angle between the pass axes of the polaroids is"

    [
      "$60^{\\circ}$"
    ],
    [
      "$30^{\\circ}$"

      "$45^{\\circ}$"
    ],
    [
      "$0^{\\circ}$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "After first polaroid, intensity is $I/2$. After second, $I' = (I/2) \\cos^2 \\theta$.",
    "Given $I' = I/4$, so $\\cos^2 \\theta = 1/2 \\Rightarrow \\theta = 45^{\\circ}$."
