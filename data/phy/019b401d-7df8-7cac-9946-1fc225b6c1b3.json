    "A positively charged particle of mass m is passed through a velocity selector. It moves horizontally with a speed v. The electric field is vertically downwards and magnetic field is into the plane of the paper. Now, the electric field is switched off at $t=0$. The angular momentum of the charged particle about origin O at $t=\\frac{\\pi m}{qB}$ is",

  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "At $t=\\frac{\\pi m}{qB}$ (half time period), the particle has moved in a semi-circle of radius $r = \\frac{mv}{qB}$ to a position $y=2r$ and velocity $-v\\hat{i}$.",
    "Angular momentum $L = mvr_{\\perp} = m(v)(2r) = 2m v \\frac{mv}{qB} = \\frac{2m^2 v^2}{qB}$.",
    "Since $v = E/B$, $L = \\frac{2m^2 (E/B)^2}{qB} = \\frac{2m^2 E^2}{q B^3}$.",
