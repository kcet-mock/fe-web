  "question": [
    "In the projectile motion of a particle on a level ground, which of the following remains constant with reference to time and position?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Average velocity between any two points"
    ],
    [
      "Horizontal component of velocity"
    ],
    [
      "Angle between instantaneous velocity with horizontal"
    ],
    [
      "Vertical component of velocity"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Horizontal component of velocity remains constant because there is no acceleration in the horizontal direction (ignoring air resistance)."
