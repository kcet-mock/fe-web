    "A capacitor of capacitance <katex>$5\\mu F$</katex> is charged by a battery of emf 10 V. At an instant of time, the potential difference across the capacitor is 4 V and the time rate of change of potential difference across the capacitor is <katex>$0.6Vs^{-1}$</katex> Then the time rate at which energy is stored in the capacitor at that instant is"

    "Energy <katex>$U = \\frac{1}{2} C V^2$</katex>.",
    "Rate of energy storage <katex>$\\frac{dU}{dt} = C V \\frac{dV}{dt}$</katex>.",
    "<katex>$\\frac{dU}{dt} = 5 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 4 \\times 0.6 = 12 \\times 10^{-6} W = 12~\\mu W$</katex>."
