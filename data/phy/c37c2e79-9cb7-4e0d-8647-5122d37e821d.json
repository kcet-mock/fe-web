  "question": [
    "A uniform electric field vector <katex>$\\vec{E}$</katex> exists along horizontal direction as shown. The electric potential at A is VA. A small point charge q is slowly taken from A to B along the curved path as shown. The potential energy of the charge when it is at point B is",

    [
      "<katex>$q[V_A - Ex]$</katex>"

  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Potential decreases in the direction of the electric field.",
    "If A is at origin (conceptually) or reference <katex>$V_A$</katex>, and B is at horizontal distance x downfield.",
    "<katex>$V_B = V_A - Ex$</katex>.",
    "Potential Energy <katex>$U_B = q V_B = q(V_A - Ex)$</katex>."
