    "A luminous point object O is placed at a distance 2R from the spherical boundary separating two transparent media of refractive indices n₁ and n₂ as shown, where R is the radius of curvature of the spherical surface. If n₁ = 4/3, n₂ = 3/2 and R = 10 cm, the image is obtained at a distance from P equal to",

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Formula: n₂/v - n₁/u = (n₂ - n₁)/R.",
    "Given u = -20 cm, R = +10 cm, n₁ = 4/3, n₂ = 3/2.",
    "(1.5/v) - (1.33/-20) = (1.5 - 1.33)/10 => 1.5/v + 0.066 = 0.0166.",
    "1.5/v = -0.05 => v = -30 cm.",
    "The negative sign indicates a virtual image formed in the incident (rarer) medium."
