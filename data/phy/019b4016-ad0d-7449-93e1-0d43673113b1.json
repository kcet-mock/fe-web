    "Three polaroid sheets are co-axially placed as indicated in the diagram. Pass axes of the polaroids 2 and 3 make $30^{\\circ}$ and $90^{\\circ}$ with pass axis of polaroid sheet 1. If $I_{0}$ is the intensity of the incident unpolarised light entering sheet 1, the intensity of the emergent light through sheet 3 is",

    "After P2 ($30^{\\circ}$): $I_2 = I_1 \\cos^2(30) = (I_0/2)(3/4) = 3I_0/8$.",
    "After P3 ($90^{\\circ}$ relative to P1, so $60^{\\circ}$ relative to P2): $I_3 = I_2 \\cos^2(60) = (3I_0/8)(1/4) = 3I_0/32$."
