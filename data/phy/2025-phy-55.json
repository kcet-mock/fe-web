    "In an experiment to determine the figure of merit of a galvanometer by half deflection method, a student constructed the circuit. He unplugged a resistance of <katex>$5200 \\Omega$</katex> in R. When <katex>$K_1$</katex> is closed and <katex>$K_2$</katex> is open, the deflection observed in the galvanometer is 26 div. When <katex>$K_2$</katex> is also closed and a resistance of <katex>$90 \\Omega$</katex> is removed in S, the deflection becomes 13 div. The resistance of galvanometer is nearly"

  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Using the relation for half deflection: <katex>$G \\approx S$</katex> (if R is high).",
    "Precise calculation: <katex>$G = \\frac{RS}{R-S} \\approx S$</katex>.",
    "More accurate solution steps typically give <katex>$G = 91.6 \\Omega$</katex>."
