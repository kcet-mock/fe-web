  "explanation": [
    "Young's modulus <katex>$Y = \\frac{FL}{A\\Delta l}$</katex>, so <katex>$\\Delta l = \\frac{FL}{AY} = \\frac{FL}{\\pi r^2 Y}$</katex>.",
    "Ratio <katex>$\\frac{\\Delta l_1}{\\Delta l_2} = \\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\times (\\frac{r_2}{r_1})^2$</katex> (since F and Y are same).",
    "Given <katex>$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{1}{3}$</katex> and <katex>$\\frac{d_1}{d_2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\Rightarrow \\frac{r_1}{r_2} = \\frac{1}{2}$</katex>.",
    "<katex>$\\frac{\\Delta l_1}{\\Delta l_2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times (\\frac{2}{1})^2 = \\frac{4}{3}$</katex>."
