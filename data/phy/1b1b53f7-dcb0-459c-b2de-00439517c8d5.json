  "question": [
    "For a given pair of transparent media, the critical angle for which colour is maximum?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Blue"
    ],
    [
      "Violet"
    ],
    [
      "Green"
    ],
    [
      "Red"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Critical angle <katex>$C$</katex> is given by <katex>$\\sin C = \\frac{1}{\\mu}$</katex>.",
    "Refractive index <katex>$\\mu$</katex> is inversely proportional to wavelength (<katex>$\\lambda$</katex>) (Cauchy's relation). Red has the longest wavelength, so it has the lowest refractive index.",
    "Since <katex>$\\mu$</katex> is lowest for Red, <katex>$\\sin C$</katex> is maximum for Red.",
    "Therefore, the critical angle is maximum for Red light."
