  "question": [
    "The ratio of volume of Al²⁷ nucleus to its surface area is (Given R₀ = 1.2 × 10⁻¹⁵ m)"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "2.1 × 10⁻¹⁵ m"
    ],
    [
      "1.3 × 10⁻¹⁵ m"
    ],
    [
      "0.22 × 10⁻¹⁵ m"
    ],
    [
      "1.2 × 10⁻¹⁵ m"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Volume V = (4/3)πR³. Surface Area A = 4πR². Ratio V/A = R/3.",
    "Radius R = R₀(A)^(1/3) = 1.2(27)^(1/3) = 1.2 × 3 = 3.6 fm.",
    "Ratio = 3.6 / 3 = 1.2 fm = 1.2 × 10⁻¹⁵ m."
