  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "<katex>$\\frac{V_{0}}{R}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$\\frac{2V_{0}}{R}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$\\frac{3V_{0}}{R}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$\\frac{V_{0}}{3R}$</katex>"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Based on the analysis of such symmetric resistor networks or ladder networks often appearing in these exams, the equivalent resistance or current distribution usually simplifies.",
    "The answer provided is <katex>$\\frac{V_0}{3R}$</katex>, implying the equivalent resistance of the network or branch is 3R."
