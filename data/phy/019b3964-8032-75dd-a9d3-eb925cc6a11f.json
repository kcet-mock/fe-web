  "question": [
    "Two stones begin to fall from rest from the same height, with the second stone starting to fall 'Δt' seconds after the first falls from rest. The distance of separation between the two stones becomes 'H', 't₀' seconds after the first stone starts its motion. Then t₀ is equal to"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "H/2gΔt + Δt"
    ],
    [
      "H/gΔt - Δt/2"
    ],
    [
      "H/gΔt + Δt/2"
    ],
    [
      "H/gΔt"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Distance of 1st stone S1 = 1/2 g t₀².",
    "Distance of 2nd stone S2 = 1/2 g (t₀ - Δt)².",
    "Separation H = S1 - S2 = 1/2 g [t₀² - (t₀ - Δt)²] = 1/2 g [2t₀Δt - Δt²].",
    "2H/g = 2t₀Δt - Δt².",
    "2t₀Δt = 2H/g + Δt².",
    "t₀ = H/(gΔt) + Δt/2.",
