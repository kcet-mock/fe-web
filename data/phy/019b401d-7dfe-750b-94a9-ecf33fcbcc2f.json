  "question": [
    "The speed of sound in an ideal gas at a given temperature T is v. The rms speed of gas molecules at that temperature is $V_{rms}$. The ratio of the velocities v and $V_{rms}$ for helium and oxygen gases are X and X' respectively. Then $\\frac{X}{X^{\\prime}}$ is equal to"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "$\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{21}}$"
    ],
    [
      "$\\frac{21}{5}$"
    ],
    [
      "$\\frac{21}{\\sqrt{5}}$"
    ],
    [
      "$\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{21}}$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Ratio $X = v/V_{rms} = \\sqrt{\\gamma/3}$.",
    "For Helium (monoatomic), $\\gamma=5/3$. For Oxygen (diatomic), $\\gamma=7/5$.",
    "Ratio of ratios = $\\sqrt{(5/3)/(7/5)} = \\sqrt{25/21} = 5/\\sqrt{21}$."
