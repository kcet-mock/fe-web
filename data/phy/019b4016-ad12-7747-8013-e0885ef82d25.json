    "A uniform magnetic field of strength B = 2 mT exists vertically downwards. These magnetic field lines pass through a closed surface as shown in the figure. The closed surface consists of a hemisphere S1 a right circular cone S2 and a circular surface S3. The magnetic flux through S1 and S2 are respectively",

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Note: The source marks this question as Bonus/Ambiguous due to unit issues.",
    "Physically, flux entering the open surface of the hemisphere or cone from the uniform field equals $B \\times Area_{projected}$.",
    "Calculated values depend on the interpretation of radius units provided in the diagram."
