  "question": [
    "In an experiment to determine the figure of merit of a galvanometer by half deflection method, a student constructed the following circuit. He unplugged a resistance of $5200\\Omega$ in R. When $K_1$ is closed and $K_2$ is open, the deflection observed in the galvanometer is 26 div. When $K_2$ is also closed and a resistance of $90\\Omega$ is removed in S, the deflection between 13 div. The resistance of galvanometer is nearly",

  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "In the half-deflection method, if the deflection becomes exactly half when shunt S is connected, then the Galvanometer resistance $G$ is approximately equal to the Shunt resistance $S$, provided $R >> G$.",
    "Here $S = 90\\Omega$.",
    "Using the exact formula $G = \\frac{RS}{R-S}$ leads to slightly higher values, or using deflection proportionality.",
    "The standard approximation yields $G \\approx S = 90\\Omega$.",
    "The closest specific answer calculated in the solution (likely using full formula accounting for circuit changes) is 91.6 $\\Omega$."
