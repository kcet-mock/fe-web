  "question": [
    "An ideal transformer has a turns ratio of 10. When the primary is connected to 220V, 50 Hz ac source, the power output is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Equal to power input"
    ],
    [
      "Zero"
    ],
    [
      "10 times the power input"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$\\frac{1}{10}$</katex> the power input"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "For an *ideal* transformer, there are no energy losses.",
    "Therefore, Power Output = Power Input.",
    "The turns ratio affects voltage and current, but power (<katex>$P=VI$</katex>) remains conserved."
