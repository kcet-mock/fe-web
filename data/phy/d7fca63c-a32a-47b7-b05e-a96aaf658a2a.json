    "In an experiment to determine the figure of merit of a galvanometer by half deflection method, a student constructed the following circuit. He unplugged a resistance of 5200$\\Omega$ in R. When K1 is closed and K2 is open, the deflection observed in the galvanometer is 26 div. When K2 is also closed and a resistance of 90$\\Omega$ is removed in S, the deflection between 13 div. The resistance of galvanometer is nearly",
