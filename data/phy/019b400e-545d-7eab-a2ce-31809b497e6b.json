  "question": [
    "Which of the following expression can be deduced on the basis of dimensional analysis? (All symbols have their usual meanings)"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "$x = A \\cos \\omega t$"
    ],
    [
      "$N = N_0 e^{-\\lambda t}$"
    ],
    [
      "$F = 6 \\pi \\eta r v$"
    ],
    [
      "$s = ut + \\frac{1}{2}at^2$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Dimensional analysis cannot determine dimensionless constants (like $1/2$ or $6\\pi$) or the form of transcendental functions (exponential, trigonometric).",
    "However, in the context of school physics problems, Stokes' Law ($F \\propto \\eta^a r^b v^c$) is the classic example where power dependencies are derived dimensionally, whereas the other equations imply knowledge of constants or functions that dimensional analysis alone cannot prove."
