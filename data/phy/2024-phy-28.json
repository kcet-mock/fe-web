  "question": [
    "A block of certain mass is placed on a rough inclined plane. The angle between the plane and the horizontal is <katex>$30^{\\circ}$</katex>. The coefficients of static and kinetic frictions between the block and the inclined plane are 0.6 and 0.5 respectively. Then the magnitude of the acceleration of the block is [Take <katex>$g=10~ms^{-2}$</katex>]"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "<katex>$2~ms^{-2}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "zero"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$0.196~ms^{-2}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$0.67~ms^{-2}$</katex>"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Check if block moves: Downward component <katex>$g \\sin 30 = 10(0.5) = 5$</katex>.",
    "Max static friction <katex>$f_s = \\mu_s g \\cos 30 = 0.6 \\times 10 \\times 0.866 = 5.196$</katex>.",
    "Since <katex>$g \\sin 30 < f_s$</katex>, the block does not move. Acceleration is zero."
