  "question": [
    "Consider the nuclear fission reaction ⁰n¹ + ₙ₂U²³⁵ → ₅₆Ba¹⁴⁴ + ₃₆Kr⁸⁹ + 3 ⁰n¹. Assuming all the kinetic energy is carried away by the fast neutrons only and total binding energies of U, Ba and Kr to be 1800 MeV, 1200 MeV and 780 MeV respectively, the average kinetic energy carried by each fast neutron is (in MeV)"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "200"
    ],
    [
      "180"
    ],
    [
      "67"
    ],
    [
      "60"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Energy Released Q = Final BE - Initial BE = (1200 + 780) - 1800 = 1980 - 1800 = 180 MeV.",
    "This energy is carried by 3 neutrons.",
    "Average KE per neutron = 180 / 3 = 60 MeV."
