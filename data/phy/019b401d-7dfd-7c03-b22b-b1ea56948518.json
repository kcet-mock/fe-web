  "question": [
    "A particle is in uniform circular motion. Related to one complete revolution of the particle, which among the statements is correct?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Average speed of the particle is zero"
    ],
    [
      "Average velocity of the particle is zero"
    ],
    [
      "Average acceleration of the particle is zero"
    ],
    [
      "Displacement of the particle is zero"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Note: The provided answer key indicates (A), which states 'Average speed is zero'. Physically, for a complete revolution, Displacement is zero and Average Velocity is zero. Average speed is non-zero. If (A) is the key, the question likely asks for the incorrect statement."
