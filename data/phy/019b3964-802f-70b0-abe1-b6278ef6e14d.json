  "question": [
    "Given, a current carrying wire of non-uniform cross-section, which of the following is constant throughout the length of wire?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Drift speed"
    ],
    [
      "Current and drift speed"
    ],
    [
      "Current only"
    ],
    [
      "Current, electric field and drift speed"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "According to the principle of continuity, the electric current is the same at every cross-section of the conductor, regardless of the area.",
    "Drift speed and electric field depend on the cross-sectional area (I = nAev_d).",
