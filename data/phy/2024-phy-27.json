    "Among the given pair of vectors, the resultant of two vectors can never be 3 units. The vectors are"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "1 unit and 2 units"
    ],
    [
      "2 units and 5 units"
    ],
    [
      "3 units and 6 units"
    ],
    [
      "4 units and 8 units"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": [
    "The resultant R of two vectors A and B lies in the range <katex>$|A-B| \\le R \\le A+B$</katex>.",
    "For (D) 4 and 8: Range is <katex>$|8-4|$</katex> to <katex>$8+4$</katex>, i.e., [4, 12].",
    "3 units is outside this range."
