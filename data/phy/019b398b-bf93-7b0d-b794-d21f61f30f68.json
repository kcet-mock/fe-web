  "question": [
    "A point of charge A of +10 μC and another point charge B of +20 μC are kept 1 m apart in free space. The electrostatic force on A due to B is F₁ and the electrostatic force on B due to A is F₂. Then"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "F₁ = -2F₂"
    ],
    [
      "F₁ = -F₂"
    ],
    [
      "2F₁ = -F₂"
    ],
    [
      "F₁ = F₂"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "According to Newton's Third Law and Coulomb's Law, the electrostatic forces between two point charges are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.",
    "Thus, Vector F₁ = - Vector F₂."
