  "question": [
    "The total electric flux through a closed spherical surface of radius 'r' enclosing an electric dipole of dipole moment 2aq is (Given ε₀ = permittivity of free space)"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Zero"
    ],
    [
      "q/ε₀"
    ],
    [
      "2q/ε₀"
    ],
    [
      "8πr²q/ε₀"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "An electric dipole consists of two equal and opposite charges (+q and -q).",
    "The net charge enclosed by the surface is +q + (-q) = 0.",
    "According to Gauss's Law, total flux Φ = q_enclosed / ε₀ = 0."
