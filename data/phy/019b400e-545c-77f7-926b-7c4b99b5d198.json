  "question": [
    "Which of the following statements is correct for an n-type semiconductor?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "The donor energy level lies closely above the top of the valance band"
    ],
    [
      "The donor energy level lies at the half way mark of forbidden energy gap"
    ],
    [
      "The donor energy level does not exist"
    ],
    [
      "The donor energy level lies just the bottom of the conduction band"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "In n-type semiconductors, pentavalent impurities donate electrons.",
    "The donor energy levels are located very close to and just below the bottom of the conduction band, allowing electrons to jump easily into the conduction band."
