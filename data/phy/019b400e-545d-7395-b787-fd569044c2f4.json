  "question": [
    "A particle is in uniform circular motion. The equation of its trajectory is given by $(x-2)^2 + y^2 = 25$, where x and y are in meter. The speed of the particle is 2ms$^{-1}$, when the particle attains the lowest 'y' co-ordinate, the acceleration of the particle is (in ms$^{-2}$)"

    [
      "0.4$\\hat{j}$"
    ],
    [
      "0.8$\\hat{i}$"
    ],
    [
      "0.8$\\hat{j}$"
    ],
    [
      "0.4$\\hat{i}$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "The equation represents a circle with center $(2, 0)$ and radius $R = 5$m.",
    "The lowest y-coordinate is at $(2, -5)$.",
    "Centripetal acceleration magnitude $a_c = v^2/R = 2^2/5 = 4/5 = 0.8 m/s^2$.",
    "The direction of centripetal acceleration is always towards the center. From the lowest point $(2, -5)$ towards the center $(2, 0)$, the direction is vertically upwards ($+\\hat{j}$).",
    "Thus, $\\vec{a} = 0.8 \\hat{j}$."
