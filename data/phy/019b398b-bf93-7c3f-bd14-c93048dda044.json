  "question": [
    "A capacitor of capacitance 5 μF is charged by a battery of emf 10 V. At an instant of time, the potential difference across the capacitor is 4 V and the time rate of change of potential difference across the capacitor is 0.6 Vs⁻¹. Then the time rate at which energy is stored in the capacitor at that instant is"

    [
      "12 μW"
    ],
    [
      "3 μW"

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Energy U = (1/2)CV².",
    "Rate dU/dt = C × V × (dV/dt).",
    "dU/dt = 5 × 10⁻⁶ × 4 × 0.6 = 12 × 10⁻⁶ W = 12 μW."
