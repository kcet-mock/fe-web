  "question": [
    "A gas is taken from state A to state B along two different paths 1 and 2. The heat absorbed and work done by the system along these two paths are <katex>$Q_1, Q_2$</katex> and <katex>$W_1, W_2$</katex> respectively. Then"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "<katex>$W_1 = W_2$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$Q_1 - W_1 = Q_2 - W_2$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$Q_1 + W_1 = Q_2 + W_2$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$Q_1 = Q_2$</katex>"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "According to the First Law of Thermodynamics, <katex>$\\Delta U = Q - W$</katex>.",
    "Since the initial and final states (A and B) are the same for both paths, the change in internal energy <katex>$\\Delta U$</katex> is the same.",
    "<katex>$\\Delta U_1 = \\Delta U_2 \\Rightarrow Q_1 - W_1 = Q_2 - W_2$</katex>."
