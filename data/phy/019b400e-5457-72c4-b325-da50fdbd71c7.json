    "Extension $\\Delta l = \\frac{Fl}{AY} = \\frac{Fl}{\\pi r^2 Y}$.",
    "Ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta l_1}{\\Delta l_2} = (\\frac{l_1}{l_2}) \\times (\\frac{r_2}{r_1})^2$",
    "Given $l_1/l_2 = 1/3$ and $d_1/d_2 = 1/2 \\Rightarrow r_1/r_2 = 1/2$.",
    "$\\frac{\\Delta l_1}{\\Delta l_2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times (\\frac{2}{1})^2 = \\frac{4}{3}$."
