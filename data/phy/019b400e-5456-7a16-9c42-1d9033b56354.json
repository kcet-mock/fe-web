  "question": [
    "The total energy of a satellite in a circular orbit at a distance $(R+h)$ from the centre of the Earth varies as [R is the radius of the Earth and h is the height of the orbit from Earth's surface]"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "$-\\frac{1}{(R+h)}$"
    ],
    [
      "$\\frac{1}{(R+h)^{2}}$"
    ],
    [
      "$-\\frac{1}{(R+h)^{2}}$"
    ],
    [
      "$\\frac{1}{(R+h)}$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "The total energy of a satellite is given by $E = -\\frac{GMm}{2r}$.",
    "Here $r = R+h$.",
    "Therefore, $E \\propto -\\frac{1}{(R+h)}$."
