  "question": [
    "A motor-cyclist moving towards a huge cliff with a speed of 18 kmh⁻¹, blows a horn of source frequency 325 Hz. If the speed of the sound in air is 330 ms⁻¹, the number of beats heard by him is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "5"
    ],
    [
      "4"
    ],
    [
      "10"
    ],
    [
      "7"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Speed of source vs = 18 km/h = 5 m/s. Sound speed v = 330 m/s.",
    "Frequency of reflected sound f' = f₀(v+vs)/(v-vs) = 325(335/325) = 335 Hz.",
    "Beats = f' - f₀ = 335 - 325 = 10 Hz."
  ]
