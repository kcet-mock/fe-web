  "question": [
    "In the Rutherford's alpha scattering experiment, as the impact parameter increases, the scattering angle of the alpha particle"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Decreases"
    ],
    [
      "Increases"
    ],
    [
      "Remains the same"
    ],
    [
      "Is always $90^{\\circ}$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Scattering angle $\\theta$ and impact parameter $b$ are inversely related. Large $b$ (distant approach) results in small scattering angles."
