  "question": [
    "If $v_{p}$, $L_{p}$ and $r_{p}$ are radii, velocities and angular momenta of a planet at perihelion and $v_{a}$, $L_{a}$, $r_{a}$ are those at aphelion of its elliptical orbit around the Sun respectively, then"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "$r_{p} > r_{a}$, $v_{p} > v_{a}$, $L_{a} > L_{p}$"
    ],
    [
      "$r_{p} < r_{a}$, $v_{p} > v_{a}$, $L_{a} = L_{p}$"
    ],
    [
      "$r_{p} > r_{a}$, $v_{p} < v_{a}$, $L_{a} = L_{p}$"
    ],
    [
      "$r_{p} < r_{a}$, $v_{p} < v_{a}$, $L_{a} < L_{p}$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Angular momentum is conserved: $L_p = L_a$.",
    "Perihelion is the closest point: $r_p < r_a$.",
    "Since $L = mvr$, and $L$ is constant, $v \\propto 1/r$. Therefore $v_p > v_a$."
