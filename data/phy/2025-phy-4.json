  "question": [
    "During an elastic collision between two bodies, which of the following statements are correct?",
    "I. The initial kinetic energy is equal to the final kinetic energy of the system.",
    "II. The linear momentum is conserved.",
    "III. The kinetic energy during the collision time <katex>$\\Delta t$</katex> is not conserved."
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "II and III only"
    ],
    [
      "I and III only"
    ],
    [
      "I, II and III"
    ],
    [
      "I and II only"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "In an elastic collision:",
    "1. Total kinetic energy before collision equals total kinetic energy after collision (Statement I is correct).",
    "2. Linear momentum is always conserved (Statement II is correct).",
    "3. During the brief collision interval, some KE is converted to potential energy of deformation, so KE is not conserved *during* the impact (Statement III is correct)."
