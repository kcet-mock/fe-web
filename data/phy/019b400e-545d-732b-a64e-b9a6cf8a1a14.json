    "In determining the refractive index of a glass slab using a travelling microscope, the following readings are tabulated:",
    "(a) Reading of travelling microscope for ink mark = 5.123 cm",
    "(b) Reading of travelling microscope for ink mark through glass slab = 6.123 cm",
    "(c) Reading of travelling microscope for chalk dust on glass slab = 8.123 cm",
    "From the data, the refractive index of a glass slab is"

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Real Depth = Reading(surface) - Reading(bottom) = 8.123 - 5.123 = 3.0 cm.",
    "Apparent Depth = Reading(surface) - Reading(apparent bottom) = 8.123 - 6.123 = 2.0 cm.",
    "Refractive Index $\\mu = \\frac{\\text{Real Depth}}{\\text{Apparent Depth}} = \\frac{3.0}{2.0} = 1.5$."
