  "question": [
    "A horizontal pipe carries water in a streamlined flow. At a point along the pipe, where the cross-sectional area is 10 cm², the velocity of water is 1 ms⁻¹ and the pressure is 2000 Pa. What is the pressure of water at another point where the cross-sectional area is 5 cm²? [Density of water = 1000 kgm⁻³]"

  "choices": [
    [
      "300 Pa"
    ],
    [
      "400 Pa"

    [
      "500 Pa"
    ],
    [
      "200 Pa"
    ]

  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Using continuity equation A₁V₁ = A₂V₂: 10*1 = 5*V₂ => V₂ = 2 m/s.",
    "Using Bernoulli's equation: P₁ + 1/2 ρV₁² = P₂ + 1/2 ρV₂².",
    "2000 + 0.5*1000*(1)² = P₂ + 0.5*1000*(2)².",
    "2000 + 500 = P₂ + 2000.",
    "P₂ = 500 Pa.",
