  "explanation": [
    "Total dipole moment P_tot = 100 × 0.2 × 10⁻⁶ = 2 × 10⁻⁵ Cm.",
    "Volume V = (10⁻²)³ = 10⁻⁶ m³.",
    "Polarization P = P_tot / V = 20 C/m².",
    "Assuming the question implies P = χE (using non-standard definition fitting the options), χ = 20 / 4 = 5. (Standard physics uses P = χε₀E, leading to different dimensionless value)."
