  "question": [
    "A square loop of side length 'a' is moving away from an infinitely long current carrying conductor at a constant speed 'v' as shown. Let 'x' be the instantaneous distance between the long conductor and side AB. The mutual inductance (M) of the square loop - long conductor pair changes with time (t) according to which of the following graphs?",

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Flux through the loop $\\phi = \\int B dA$. The magnetic field $B \\propto 1/x$.",
    "Distance $x = vt$. So $B \\propto 1/t$.",
    "Mutual inductance $M = \\phi/I$. Thus $M$ decreases inversely with time ($M \\propto 1/t$), representing a rectangular hyperbola."
