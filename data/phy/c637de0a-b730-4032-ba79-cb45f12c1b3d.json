  "question": [
    "The circuit shown in figure contains two ideal diodes D1 and D2. If a cell of emf 3V and negligible internal resistance is connected as shown, then the current through <katex>$70\\Omega$</katex> resistance, (in ampere) is",

  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Diode D1 is reverse biased (open circuit). Diode D2 is forward biased (short circuit).",
    "Effective resistance <katex>$R = 30 + 70 = 100 \\Omega$</katex>.",
    "Current <katex>$I = V/R = 3/100 = 0.03$</katex> A."
