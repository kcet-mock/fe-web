    "A positively charged particle of mass m is passed through a velocity selector. It moves horizontally rightward without deviation along the line <katex>$y=\\frac{2mv}{qB}$</katex> with a speed v. The electric field is vertically downwards and magnetic field is into the plane of the paper. Now, the electric field is switched off at <katex>$t=0$</katex>. The angular momentum of the charged particle about origin O at <katex>$t=\\frac{\\pi m}{qB}$</katex> is",
