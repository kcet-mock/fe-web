    "Two cells of emfs $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ and internal resistances $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ $(E_{2}>E_{1}$ and $r_{2}>r_{1})$ respectively, are connected in parallel as shown in figure. The equivalent emf of the combination is $E_{eq}$. Then",

  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "The equivalent EMF for parallel combination is weighted by inverse resistance: $E_{eq} = \\frac{E_1/r_1 + E_2/r_2}{1/r_1 + 1/r_2}$.",
    "The value of $E_{eq}$ always lies between $E_1$ and $E_2$.",
    "Since $r_1 < r_2$, the cell with lower internal resistance ($E_1$) dominates the equivalent value, so $E_{eq}$ is closer to $E_1$."
