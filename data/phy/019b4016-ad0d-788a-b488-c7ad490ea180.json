  "question": [
    "In Young's double slit experiment, an electron beam is used to produce interference fringes of width $\\beta_{1}$. Now the electron beam is replaced by a beam of protons with the same experimental set-up and same speed. The fringe width obtained is $\\beta_{2}$. The correct relation between $\\beta_{1}$ and $\\beta_{2}$ is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "$\\beta_{1}=\\beta_{2}$"
    ],
    [
      "No fringes are formed"
    ],
    [
      "$\\beta_{1}<\\beta_{2}$"
    ],
    [
      "$\\beta_{1}>\\beta_{2}$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Fringe width $\\beta \\propto \\lambda$. de Broglie wavelength $\\lambda = h/mv$.",
    "Mass of proton > Mass of electron. Thus $\\lambda_p < \\lambda_e$.",
    "Consequently, $\\beta_2 (proton) < \\beta_1 (electron)$, or $\\beta_1 > \\beta_2$."
