  "question": [
    "Two similar galvanometers are covered into an ammeter and a milliammeter. The shunt resistance of ammeter as compared to the shunt resistance of milliammeter will be"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Zero"
    ],
    [
      "More"
    ],
    [
      "Less"
    ],
    [
      "Equal"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Shunt resistance <katex>$S = \\frac{I_g G}{I - I_g}$</katex>.",
    "For Ammeter, range I is large (e.g., 1A). For Milliammeter, range I is small (e.g., 1mA).",
    "Since <katex>$S \\propto \\frac{1}{I}$</katex> approximately, larger range requires smaller shunt.",
    "Therefore, Ammeter (larger range) has Less shunt resistance."
