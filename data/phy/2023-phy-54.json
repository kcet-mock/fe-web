  "question": [
    "Ten identical cells each emf 2V and internal resistance 1 <katex>$\\Omega$</katex> are connected in series with two cells wrongly connected. A resistor of 10 <katex>$\\Omega$</katex> is connected to the combination. What is the current through the resistor?"

  "choices": [
    [
      "0.6 A"
    ],
    [
      "1.2 A"
    ],
    [
      "1.8 A"
    ],
    [
      "2.4 A"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Total cells n = 10. Wrongly connected m = 2. Effective emf <katex>$E_{eff} = (n - 2m)E = (10 - 4) \\times 2 = 12$</katex> V. Total resistance <katex>$R_{total} = R + nr = 10 + 10(1) = 20 \\Omega$</katex>. Current <katex>$I = 12/20 = 0.6$</katex> A."
