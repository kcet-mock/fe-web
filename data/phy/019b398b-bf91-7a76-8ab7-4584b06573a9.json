    "The natural logarithm of the activity R of a radioactive sample varies with time t as shown. At t = 0, there are N₀ undecayed nuclei. Then N₀ is equal to [Take e² = 7.5]",

  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "From the graph, at t=0, ln R = 2. So R₀ = e².",
    "The slope λ = (2-1)/(10000) = 10⁻⁴.",
    "R₀ = λN₀ => N₀ = R₀/λ = e² / 10⁻⁴ = 7.5 × 10⁴ = 75,000."
