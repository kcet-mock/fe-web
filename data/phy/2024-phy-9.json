    "A luminous point object O is placed at a distance 2R from the spherical boundary separating two transparent media of refractive indices <katex>$n_{1}$</katex> and <katex>$n_{2}$</katex> as shown, where R is the radius of curvature of the spherical surface. If <katex>$n_{1}=\\frac{4}{3}, n_{2}=\\frac{3}{2}$</katex> and <katex>$R=10$</katex> cm, the image is obtained at a distance from P equal to",

  "explanation": [
    "Formula: <katex>$\\frac{n_2}{v} - \\frac{n_1}{u} = \\frac{n_2 - n_1}{R}$</katex>. Here <katex>$u = -2R = -20$</katex> cm, <katex>$R = +10$</katex> cm.",
    "<katex>$\\frac{1.5}{v} - \\frac{1.33}{-20} = \\frac{1.5 - 1.33}{10}$</katex>.",
    "Solving gives <katex>$v = -30$</katex> cm.",
    "A negative sign indicates the image is formed in the first medium (from which light is incident), which is <katex>$n_1 = 4/3$</katex> (rarer medium compared to 3/2)."
