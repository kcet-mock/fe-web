  "question": [
    "Which of the following is a correct statement?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Gauss's law is true for any open surface"
    ],
    [
      "Gauss's law is not applicable when charges are not symmetrically distributed over a closed surface"
    ],
    [
      "Gauss's law does not hold good for a charge situated outside the Gaussian surface"
    ],
    [
      "Gauss's law is true for any closed surface"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": [
    "Gauss law is valid only for closed surface and charge should be enclosed inside the closed surface to get flux through the closed surface. [cite: 370]",
    "Correct statement is (4): Gauss's law is true for any closed surface."
