    "Which of the following is a correct statement?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Gauss's law is true for any open surface"
    ],
    [
      "Gauss's law is not applicable when charges are not symmetrically distributed over a closed surface"
    ],
    [
      "Gauss's law does not hold good for a charge situated outside the Gaussian surface"
    ],
    [
      "Gauss's law is true for any closed surface"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Gauss's law states that the total flux through any *closed* surface is equal to <katex>$1/\\epsilon_0$</katex> times the enclosed charge.",
    "It is valid for any closed surface regardless of shape or charge distribution."
