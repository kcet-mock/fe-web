    "A luminous point object O is placed at a distance 2R from the spherical boundary separating two transparent media of refractive indices $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ as shown, where R is the radius of curvature of the spherical surface. If $n_{1}=\\frac{4}{3},$ $n_{2}=\\frac{3}{2}$ and $R=10$ cm, the image is obtained at a distance from P equal to",

  "explanation": [
    "Using $\\frac{n_2}{v} - \\frac{n_1}{u} = \\frac{n_2-n_1}{R}$ with $u=-20, R=+10$.",
    "$\\frac{1.5}{v} - \\frac{1.33}{-20} = \\frac{1.5-1.33}{10}$.",
    "Solving gives $v = -30$ cm.",
    "Negative sign implies a virtual image in the first medium ($n_1$, rarer)."
