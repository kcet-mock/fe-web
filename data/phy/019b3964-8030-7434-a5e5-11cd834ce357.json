    "A series LCR circuit containing an AC source of 100V has an inductor and a capacitor of reactances 24Ω and 16Ω respectively. If a resistance of 6Ω is connected in series, then the potential difference across the series combination of inductor and capacitor only is"

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Impedance Z = √[R² + (X_L - X_C)²] = √[6² + (24-16)²] = √[36 + 64] = 10Ω.",
    "Current I = V/Z = 100/10 = 10 A.",
    "Voltage across L and C combination = I * (X_L - X_C) = 10 * (24 - 16) = 80 V.",
