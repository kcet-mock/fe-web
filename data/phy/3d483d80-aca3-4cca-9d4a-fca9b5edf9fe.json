  "question": [
    "A full-wave rectifier with diodes <katex>$D_{1}$</katex> and <katex>$D_{2}$</katex> is used to rectify 50 Hz alternating voltage. The diode <katex>$D_{1}$</katex> conducts how many times in one second."

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "In a full-wave rectifier, <katex>$D_1$</katex> conducts during the positive half-cycles and <katex>$D_2$</katex> conducts during the negative half-cycles.",
    "The input frequency is 50 Hz, meaning there are 50 full cycles per second.",
    "Therefore, there are 50 positive half-cycles per second.",
    "<katex>$D_1$</katex> conducts once per cycle, so 50 times per second."
