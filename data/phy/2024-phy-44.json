  "question": [
    "Under electrostatic condition of a charged conductor, which among the following statements is true?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "The electric field on the surface of a charged conductor is <katex>$\\frac{\\sigma}{2\\epsilon_{0}}$</katex> where <katex>$\\sigma$</katex> is the surface charge density"
    ],
    [
      "The electric potential inside a charged conductor is always zero"
    ],
    [
      "Any excess charge resides on the surface of the conductor"
    ],
    [
      "The net electric field is tangential to the surface of the conductor"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "In electrostatics, any excess charge placed on a conductor moves to its exterior surface.",
    "Field is <katex>$\\sigma/\\epsilon_0$</katex> (not /2), potential is constant (not zero), and field is normal (not tangential)."
