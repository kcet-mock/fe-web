  "question": [
    "You are given a dipole of charge +q and -q separated by a distance 2R. A sphere 'A' of radius 'R' passes through the centre of the dipole as shown below and another sphere 'B' of radius '2R' passes through the charge +q. Then the electric flux through the sphere A is",

  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Based on the problem description and standard configurations, sphere A likely encloses only the negative charge -q (since it passes through the center and has radius R, while +q and -q are separated by 2R, placing them at distance R from center).",
    "According to Gauss's Law, Flux = (Charge Enclosed) / ε₀.",
    "Flux = -q / ε₀.",
