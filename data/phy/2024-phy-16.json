    "In alpha particle scattering experiment, if v is the initial velocity of the particle, then the distance of closest approach is d. If the velocity is doubled, then the distance of closest approach becomes"

    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Distance of closest approach <katex>$d$</katex> is obtained by equating initial KE to potential energy at closest approach: <katex>$\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \\frac{kQq}{d}$</katex>.",
    "This implies <katex>$d \\propto \\frac{1}{v^2}$</katex>.",
    "If <katex>$v$</katex> is doubled (<katex>$2v$</katex>), <katex>$d$</katex> becomes <katex>$\\frac{1}{(2)^2} = \\frac{1}{4}$</katex> of the original value."
