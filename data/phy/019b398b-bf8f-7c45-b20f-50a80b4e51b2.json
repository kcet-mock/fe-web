  "question": [
    "Electromagnetic waves are incident normally on a perfectly reflecting surface having surface area A. If I is the intensity of the incident electromagnetic radiation and c is the speed of light in vacuum, the force exerted by the electromagnetic wave on the reflecting surface is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "2IA / c"
    ],
    [
      "IA / c"
    ],
    [
      "IA / 2c"
    ],
    [
      "1 / 2Ac"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "The radiation pressure P for a perfectly reflecting surface is 2I/c.",
    "The force F is Pressure × Area = P × A.",
    "Therefore, F = 2IA/c."
