  "question": [
    "A metallic sphere of radius R carrying a charge q is kept at certain distance from another metallic sphere of radius R/4 carrying a charge Q. What is the electric flux at any point inside the metallic sphere of radius R due to the sphere of radius $R/4$?",

  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "$\\frac{q}{\\epsilon_{0}}$"
    ],
    [
      "Zero"
    ],
    [
      "$\\epsilon_{0}$"
    ],
    [
      "$\\frac{Q}{\\epsilon_{0}}$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Inside a metallic conductor (electrostatic equilibrium), the net electric field is zero due to electrostatic shielding.",
    "Therefore, the flux contribution inside the metal of the first sphere is zero."
