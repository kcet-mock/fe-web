  "question": [
    "You are given a dipole of charge +q and -q separated by a distance 2R. A sphere 'A' of radius 'R' passes through the centre of the dipole as shown below and another sphere 'B' of radius '2R' passes through the charge +q. Then the electric flux through the sphere A is",

    [
      "$q/\\epsilon_{0}$"

    [
      "$-q/\\epsilon_{0}$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Sphere A has radius R and its center is at the -q charge (based on diagram and geometry described where it passes through the center of the 2R dipole).",
    "Thus, Sphere A encloses the charge -q.",
    "By Gauss's Law, $\\phi = \\frac{q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_0} = \\frac{-q}{\\epsilon_0}$."
