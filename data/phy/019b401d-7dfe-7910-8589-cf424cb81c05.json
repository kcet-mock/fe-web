  "question": [
    "Electric field at a distance 'r' from an infinitely long uniformly charged straight conductor, having linear charge density $\\lambda$ is $E_1$. Another uniformly charged conductor having same linear charge density $\\lambda$ is bent into a semicircle of radius 'r'. The electric field at its centre is $E_2$. Then"

  "choices": [
    [
      "$E_1 = E_2$"
    ],
    [
      "$E_1 = rE_2$"

    [
      "$E_2 = rE_1$"
    ],
    [
      "$E_1 = 2rE_2$"
    ]

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "$E_1 = \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi\\epsilon_0 r}$ and $E_2 = \\frac{2k\\lambda}{r} = \\frac{2\\lambda}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi\\epsilon_0 r}$."
