  "question": [
    "An electric bulb of 60 W, 120 V is to be connected to 220 V source. What resistance should be connected in series with the bulb, so that the bulb glows properly ?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "50 Ω"
    ],
    [
      "100 Ω"
    ],
    [
      "200 Ω"
    ],
    [
      "288 Ω"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Rated current $I = P/V = 60/120 = 0.5$ A.",
    "Voltage drop required across resistor $V_R = 220 - 120 = 100$ V.",
    "Resistance $R = V_R / I = 100 / 0.5 = 200$ Ω."
