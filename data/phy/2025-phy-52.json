  "question": [
    "Which of the following statements is correct for an n-type semiconductor?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "The donor energy level lies closely above the top of the valance band"
    ],
    [
      "The donor energy level lies at the half way mark of forbidden energy gap"
    ],
    [
      "The donor energy level does not exist"
    ],
    [
      "The donor energy level lies just the bottom of the conduction band"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": [
    "In n-type semiconductor, donor impurities contribute electron energy levels high in the semiconductor band gap. [cite: 782]",
    "This donor level is located closed to, and just below, the bottom of the conduction band. [cite: 783]"
