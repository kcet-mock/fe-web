  "question": [
    "Electromagnetic waves are incident normally on a perfectly reflecting surface having surface area A. If I is the intensity of the incident electromagnetic radiation and c is the speed of light in vacuum, the force exerted by the electromagnetic wave on the reflecting surface is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "<katex>$\\frac{2IA}{c}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$\\frac{IA}{c}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$\\frac{IA}{2c}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$\\frac{I}{2Ac}$</katex>"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "For a perfectly reflecting surface, the change in momentum is double that of an absorbing surface.",
    "Momentum transferred per unit time (Force) = <katex>$\\frac{2 \\times \\text{Power}}{c}$</katex>.",
    "Since Power <katex>$P = IA$</katex>, the Force <katex>$F = \\frac{2IA}{c}$</katex>."
