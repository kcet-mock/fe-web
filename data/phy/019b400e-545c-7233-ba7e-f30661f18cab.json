  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Power of $L_2$ is $P/2$"
    ],
    [
      "Power of $L_3$ is $P/2$"
    ],
    [
      "Power of $L_1$ is $P$"
    ],
    [
      "Power of $L_1$ is $P/2$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "$L_1$ is obtained by cutting along the principal axis. This does not change the focal length, so Power remains P. Thus, statement (3) is correct.",
    "$L_2$ and $L_3$ are obtained by cutting perpendicular to the axis, making them plano-convex. This doubles the focal length, so Power becomes $P/2$.",
    "Statement (4) says 'Power of $L_1$ is $P/2$', which is incorrect. The question asks for the incorrect option."
