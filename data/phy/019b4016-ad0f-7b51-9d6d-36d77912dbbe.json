    "What is the value of acceleration due to gravity at a height equal to half the radius of the Earth, from its surface ?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "$4.4~ms^{-2}$"
    ],
    [
      "$6.5~ms^{-2}$"

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "$g' = g \\frac{R^2}{(R+h)^2} = g \\frac{R^2}{(1.5R)^2} = g/2.25$.",
    "$g' = 9.8 / 2.25 \\approx 4.35$ m/s²."
