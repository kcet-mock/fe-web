  "question": [
    "A p-n junction diode is connected to a battery of emf 5.7 V in series with a resistance 5 Ω such that it is forward biased. If the barrier potential of the diode is 0.7 V, neglecting the diode resistance, the current in the circuit is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "1.14 mA"
    ],
    [
      "1 mA"
    ],
    [
      "1 A"
    ],
    [
      "1.14 A"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Net voltage V = 5.7 V - 0.7 V = 5.0 V.",
    "If Resistance R = 5 Ω, Current I = 5/5 = 1 A. Note: The Answer Key is B (1 mA), implying the resistance might be 5 kΩ in the original context, or there is a unit mismatch."
