    "While determining the coefficient of viscosity of the given liquid, a spherical steel ball sinks by a distance h = 0.9m. The radius of the ball $r = 3 \\times 10^{-3}$ m. The time taken by the ball to sink in three trails are tabulated as follows: 2.75s, 2.65s, 2.70s. The difference between the densities of the steel ball and the liquid is 7000 kg $m^{-3}$. If g = 10 $ms^{-2}$, then the coefficient of viscosity of the given liquid at room temperature is"
