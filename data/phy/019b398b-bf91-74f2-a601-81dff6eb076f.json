  "question": [
    "Dimensional formula for activity of a radioactive substance is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "M⁰L¹T⁻¹"
    ],
    [
      "M⁰L⁻¹T⁰"
    ],
    [
      "M⁰L⁰T⁻¹"
    ],
    [
      "M⁻¹L⁰T⁰"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Activity is defined as the number of disintegrations per unit time.",
    "Its dimension is Time⁻¹ [T⁻¹], which corresponds to M⁰L⁰T⁻¹."
  ]
