  "question": [
    "During an elastic collision between two bodies, which of the following statements are correct?",
    "I. The initial kinetic energy is equal to the final kinetic energy of the system.",
    "II. The linear momentum is conserved.",
    "III. The kinetic energy during $\\Delta t$ (the collision time) is not conserved."
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "II and III only"
    ],
    [
      "I and III only"
    ],
    [
      "I, II and III"
    ],
    [
      "I and II only"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "I. Correct: In elastic collision, total KE is conserved (Initial KE = Final KE).",
    "II. Correct: Linear momentum is always conserved in all collisions.",
    "III. Correct: During the brief collision time, some KE is temporarily converted into potential energy of deformation, so instantaneous KE is not conserved."
