  "question": [
    "The photoelectric work function for photo metal is 2.4 eV. Among the four wavelengths, the wavelength of light for which photo-emission does not take place is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "200 nm"
    ],
    [
      "300 nm"
    ],
    [
      "700 nm"
    ],
    [
      "400 nm"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Threshold wavelength <katex>$\\lambda_0 = \\frac{hc}{\\Phi} \\approx \\frac{1240 \\text{ eV nm}}{2.4 \\text{ eV}} \\approx 516 \\text{ nm}$</katex>.",
    "Photo-emission occurs only if <katex>$\\lambda < \\lambda_0$</katex>.",
    "700 nm is greater than 516 nm, so no emission will take place."
