  "choices": [
    [
      "2 $\\mu$F"
    ],
    [
      "5 $\\mu$F"
    ],
    [
      "3 $\\mu$F"
    ],
    [
      "1 $\\mu$F"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "This forms a balanced Wheatstone bridge. The central capacitor is ineffective. The equivalent capacitance is equal to the individual capacitance value C."
