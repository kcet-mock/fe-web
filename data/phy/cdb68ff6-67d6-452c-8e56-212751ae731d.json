  "question": [
    "In series LCR circuit at resonance, the phase difference between voltage and current is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "<katex>$\\frac{\\pi}{4}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$\\frac{\\pi}{2}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "Zero"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$\\pi$</katex>"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "At resonance in a series LCR circuit, the inductive reactance (<katex>$X_L$</katex>) equals the capacitive reactance (<katex>$X_C$</katex>).",
    "The net impedance is purely resistive (<katex>$Z=R$</katex>).",
    "Consequently, the voltage and current are in phase, meaning the phase difference is Zero."
