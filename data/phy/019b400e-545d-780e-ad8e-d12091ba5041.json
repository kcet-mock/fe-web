    "The circuit shown in figure contains two ideal diodes $D_1$ and $D_2$. If a cell of emf 3V and negligible internal resistance is connected as shown, then the current through $70\\Omega$ resistance, (in ampere) is",

  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Diode $D_1$ is reverse biased (cathode to positive), so no current flows in the top branch.",
    "Diode $D_2$ is forward biased (anode to positive), so current flows.",
    "Total Resistance $R = 30 + 70 = 100 \\Omega$.",
    "Current $I = V/R = 3/100 = 0.03$ A."
