  "question": [
    "A body of mass 1 kg is suspended by a weightless string which passes over a frictionless pulley of mass 2 kg as shown in the figure. The mass is released from a height of 1.6 m from the ground. With what velocity does it strike the ground?",

  "choices": [
    [
      "16 ms⁻¹"
    ],
    [
      "8 ms⁻¹"
    ],
    [
      "4√2 ms⁻¹"
    ],
    [
      "4 ms⁻¹"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Conservation of Energy: mgh = (1/2)mv² + (1/2)Iω².",
    "For pulley (disk), I = (1/2)MR² and ω = v/R.",
    "mgh = (1/2)mv² + (1/2)(1/2 M)v² = (1/2)v²(m + M/2).",
    "10(1.6) = (1/2)v²(1 + 1) => 16 = v² => v = 4 ms⁻¹."
