    "A wooden block of mass M lies on a rough floor. Another wooden block of the same mass is hanging from the point O through strings as shown in the figure. To achieve equilibrium, the co-efficient of static friction between the block on the floor with the floor itself is",

    [
      "<katex>$\\mu = \\cot\\theta$</katex>"

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "For the block on the floor to be in equilibrium, the horizontal component of tension must be balanced by the frictional force.",
    "From the diagram (implied), <katex>$T\\sin\\theta = Mg$</katex> (vertical equilibrium of hanging mass or geometry) and <katex>$T\\cos\\theta = f_s = \\mu N = \\mu Mg$</katex>.",
    "Dividing the equations: <katex>$\\frac{T\\cos\\theta}{T\\sin\\theta} = \\frac{\\mu Mg}{Mg} \\implies \\mu = \\cot\\theta$</katex>."
