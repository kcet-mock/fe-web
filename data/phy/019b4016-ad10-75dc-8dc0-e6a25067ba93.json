  "question": [
    "A point of charge A of +10 µC and another point charge B of +20 µC are kept 1 m apart in free space. The electrostatic force on A due to B is $\\vec{F}_{1}$ and the electrostatic force on B due to A is $\\vec{F}_{2}$. Then"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "$\\vec{F}_{1}=-2\\vec{F}_{2}$"
    ],
    [
      "$\\vec{F}_{1}=-\\vec{F}_{2}$"
    ],
    [
      "$2\\vec{F}_{1}=-\\vec{F}_{2}$"
    ],
    [
      "$\\vec{F}_{1}=\\vec{F}_{2}$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "According to Newton's Third Law, electrostatic forces between two charges are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction."
