  "question": [
    "Given, a current carrying wire of non-uniform cross-section, which of the following is constant throughout the length of wire?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Drift speed"
    ],
    [
      "Current and drift speed"
    ],
    [
      "Current only"
    ],
    [
      "Current, electric field and drift speed"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "In a series circuit (wire), charge conservation ensures that the Current (I) is the same at all cross-sections.",
    "Current density <katex>$J = I/A$</katex>, Electric field <katex>$E = \\rho J$</katex>, and Drift velocity <katex>$v_d = J/ne$</katex> all depend on Area (A), so they vary."
