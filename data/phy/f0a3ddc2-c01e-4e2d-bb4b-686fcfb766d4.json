  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Power of L2 is P/2"
    ],
    [
      "Power of L3 is P/2"
    ],
    [
      "Power of L1 is P"
    ],
    [
      "Power of L1 is P/2"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "L1 is the piece cut along principal axis. Cutting a lens longitudinally (horizontally) does not change its focal length or power. So Power of L1 is P.",
    "The incorrect statement is 'Power of L1 is P/2'."
