  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Photo current depends on intensity (number of photons), not frequency, provided <katex>$\\nu > \\nu_0$</katex>.",
    "Once emission starts (<katex>$\\nu > \\nu_0$</katex>), if intensity is constant, the current remains constant regardless of increasing frequency.",
    "The graph shows current starting at threshold <katex>$\\nu_0$</katex> and remaining constant."
