  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Photoelectric effect only occurs above a threshold frequency <katex>$\\nu_0$</katex>. So current is 0 for <katex>$\\nu < \\nu_0$</katex>.",
    "Once <katex>$\\nu > \\nu_0$</katex>, if intensity is constant, the photocurrent is generally constant (saturation current depends on intensity, not frequency). However, usually, we consider that current starts only after <katex>$\\nu_0$</katex>.",
    "Graph 1 shows current starting at <katex>$\\nu_0$</katex>."
