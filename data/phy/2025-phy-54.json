    "In determining the refractive index of a glass slab using a travelling microscope, the following readings are tabulated:\n(a) Reading of travelling microscope for ink mark = 5.123 cm\n(b) Reading of travelling microscope for ink mark through glass slab = 6.123 cm\n(c) Reading of travelling microscope for chalk dust on glass slab = 8.123 cm\nFrom the data, the refractive index of a glass slab is"

  "explanation": [
    "Real Depth = Reading(surface) - Reading(bottom) = 8.123 - 5.123 = 3 cm.",
    "Apparent Depth = Reading(surface) - Reading(apparent bottom) = 8.123 - 6.123 = 2 cm.",
    "Refractive Index <katex>$n = \\frac{\\text{Real Depth}}{\\text{Apparent Depth}} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5$</katex>."
