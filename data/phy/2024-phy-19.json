  "question": [
    "Consider the nuclear fission reaction <katex>${}_{0}^{1}n+_{92}^{235}U\\rightarrow_{56}^{144}Ba+_{36}^{89}Kr+3_{0}^{1}n$</katex>. Assuming all the kinetic energy is carried away by the fast neutrons only and total binding energies of <katex>${}_{92}^{235}U$</katex>, <katex>${}_{56}^{144}Ba$</katex> and <katex>${}_{36}^{89}Kr$</katex> to be 1800 MeV, 1200 MeV and 780 MeV respectively, the average kinetic energy carried by each fast neutron is (in MeV)"

  "choices": [
    [
      "200"
    ],
    [
      "180"

  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": [
    "Q-value = Binding Energy of Products - Binding Energy of Reactants.",
    "<katex>$Q = (1200 + 780) - 1800 = 1980 - 1800 = 180$</katex> MeV.",
    "This energy is shared by 3 neutrons.",
    "Energy per neutron = <katex>$\\frac{180}{3} = 60$</katex> MeV."
