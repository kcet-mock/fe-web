    "A block of certain mass is placed on a rough floor. The coefficients of static and kinetic friction between the block and the floor are 0.4 and 0.25 respectively. A constant horizontal force $F=20$ N acts on it so that the velocity of the block varies with time according to the following graph. The mass of the block is nearly (Take $g=10~ms^{-2})$",
