  "question": [
    "What is the value of acceleration due to gravity at a height equal to half the radius of the Earth, from its surface?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "4.4 ms⁻²"
    ],
    [
      "6.5 ms⁻²"
    ],
    [
      "Zero"
    ],
    [
      "9.8 ms⁻²"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "g' = g / (1 + h/R)².",
    "Here h = R/2. So g' = 9.8 / (1 + 0.5)² = 9.8 / 2.25 ≈ 4.35 ms⁻²."
