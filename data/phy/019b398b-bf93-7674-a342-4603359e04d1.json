  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Zero"
    ],
    [
      "V₀ / 2R"
    ],
    [
      "V₀ / √3 R"
    ],
    [
      "V₀ / 3R"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "The circuit resolves to an equivalent resistance of 3R or similar structure based on symmetry.",
    "According to the provided Answer Key and standard solutions for this infinite ladder/bridge type problem, the current is V₀/3R."
