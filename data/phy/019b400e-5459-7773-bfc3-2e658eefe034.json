  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "X copper, Y - semiconductor, Z - nichrome"
    ],
    [
      "X-semiconductor, Y-nichrome, Z copper"
    ],
    [
      "X-nichrome, Y copper, Z - semiconductor"
    ],
    [
      "X copper, Y - nichrome, Z - semiconductor"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "X shows a non-linear increase typical of conductors at low temp/pure metals (Copper).",
    "Y shows a linear increase with a non-zero intercept, typical of alloys (Nichrome).",
    "Z shows a decrease in resistivity with temperature, typical of semiconductors."
