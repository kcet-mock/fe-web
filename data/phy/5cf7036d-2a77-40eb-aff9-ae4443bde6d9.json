  "question": [
    "When light propagates through a given homogeneous medium, the velocities of"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Primary wavefronts are greater than or equal to those of secondary wavelets."
    ],
    [
      "Primary wavefronts and wavelets are equal"
    ],
    [
      "Primary wavefronts are larger than those of secondary wavelets"
    ],
    [
      "Primary wavefronts are lesser than those of secondary wavelets"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "According to Huygens' principle, every point on a primary wavefront acts as a source of secondary wavelets.",
    "In a homogeneous isotropic medium, the secondary wavelets spread out with the same speed as the propagation of the primary wavefront (the speed of light in that medium).",
    "Therefore, their velocities are equal."
