  "question": [
    "Pressure of ideal gas at constant volume is proportional to"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Total energy of the gas"
    ],
    [
      "Average kinetic energy of the molecules"
    ],
    [
      "Force between the molecules"
    ],
    [
      "Average potential energy of the molecules"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Pressure <katex>$P = \\frac{2}{3} E$</katex> (Kinetic energy density).",
    "Also, for ideal gas, <katex>$PV = nRT$</katex> and Energy <katex>$U = \\frac{f}{2} nRT$</katex>. So <katex>$T \\propto U$</katex>. Since <katex>$P \\propto T$</katex> at constant V, <katex>$P \\propto$</katex> Total Internal Energy.",
    "The answer key A refers to 'Total energy'. Note: For ideal gas, total energy is purely kinetic."
