    [
      "Only inside D1"
    ],
    [

    ],
    [
      "Only inside D2"
    ]

  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "In a cyclotron, the magnetic field inside the Dees only changes direction, not speed.",
    "The electric field exists only in the gap between the Dees.",
    "Acceleration (increase in speed) happens due to the electric field in the gap."
