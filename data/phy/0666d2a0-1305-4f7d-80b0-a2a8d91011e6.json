  "question": [
    "Which of the following graphs represents the variation of magnetic field B with perpendicular distance 'r' from an infinitely long, straight conductor carrying current?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Graph linear"
    ],
    [
      "Graph rectangular hyperbola"
    ],
    [
      "Graph parabolic"
    ],
    [
      "Graph exponential"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "For infinite wire: <katex>$B = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2\\pi r}$</katex>.",
    "Thus <katex>$B \\propto \\frac{1}{r}$</katex>, which is a rectangular hyperbola."
