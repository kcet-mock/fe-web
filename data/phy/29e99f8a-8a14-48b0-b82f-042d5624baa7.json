    "A particle is in uniform circular motion. Related to one complete revolution of the particle, which among the statements is correct?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Average speed of the particle is zero"
    ],
    [
      "Average velocity of the particle is zero"

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "There is a mix-up in the Answer key display order vs typical logic. Let's analyze.",
    "Displacement for one revolution is zero. Thus Average Velocity (Displacement/Time) is Zero.",
    "Average acceleration is (Change in velocity)/Time. <katex>$\\vec{v}_f = \\vec{v}_i$</katex>, so change is zero. Average acceleration is zero.",
    "Average speed is <katex>$2\\pi r / T$</katex> (non-zero).",
    "The options A, B, C, D in the snippet are text. Option A in the snippet says 'Average speed... is zero'. This is false.",
    "Option D says 'Displacement... is zero'. This is true.",
    "However, the Answer Key provided in the snippet says 'Ans. A'.",
    "Let's re-read the snippet text carefully.",
    "Snippet 401-407: (A) Avg speed zero (B) Avg velocity zero (C) Avg acc zero (D) Displacement zero. Ans. A.",
    "This is physically incorrect. Average velocity is zero. Displacement is zero. Average speed is NOT zero.",
    "Perhaps the options are shuffled or there is a transcription error in the source PDF key. Usually, 'Average Velocity is Zero' is the intended answer for UCM revolution questions.",
    "Let's look at the generated JSON structure. I will map strict text from PDF. The PDF says Ans A. I will mark Ans 0 (A), but note the physics might be weird or I misread the 'A' option text location.",
    "Correction: Looking at the PDF image visually would be better, but text says: '(A) Average speed... zero'.",
    "Actually, often questions ask 'Which is INCORRECT?'. But text says 'is correct'.",
    "Let's stick to the PDF's 'Ans. A' but double check the option mapping. In the text dump, (A) is Avg speed zero. (B) Avg velocity zero. (D) Displacement zero.",
    "Wait, (A) is usually the wrong statement in 'Select the incorrect' questions. Maybe the question is 'which is INCORRECT?'",
    "If the question is 'which is correct', D and B are correct. If the question is 'which is incorrect', A is incorrect. Given 'Ans A', the question likely asks for the Incorrect statement, but the text extracted says 'which among the statements is correct?'. I will transcribe exactly as provided, but add a note in explanation about the discrepancy."
