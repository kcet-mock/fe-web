  "choices": [
    [
      "Induced electric current is zero"
    ],
    [
      "Induced electric current is anticlockwise"
    ],
    [
      "Induced electric current is clockwise"
    ],
    [
      "Ring will come to rest"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "As the ring falls towards the wire, the magnetic flux through it increases.",
    "According to Lenz's law, the induced current will generate a field to oppose this increase.",
    "Assuming standard orientation (wire horizontal, current right), the field above is Out. Increasing Out flux induces Clockwise current to create In field."
