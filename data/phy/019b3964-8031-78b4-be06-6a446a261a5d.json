  "question": [
    "A convex lens has power P. It is cut into two halves along its principal axis. Further one piece (out of two halves) is cut into two halves perpendicular to the principal axis as shown in figure. Choose the incorrect option for the reported lens pieces",

  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Power of L2 is P/2"
    ],
    [
      "Power of L3 is P/2"
    ],
    [
      "Power of L1 is P"
    ],
    [
      "Power of L1 is P/2"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "L1 is the half cut along the principal axis. Its focal length remains same, so Power is P.",
    "L2 and L3 are obtained by cutting L1 perpendicular to the axis (forming plano-convex lenses). Their focal length doubles, so Power becomes P/2.",
    "Statement (4) claims L1 is P/2, which is incorrect.",
