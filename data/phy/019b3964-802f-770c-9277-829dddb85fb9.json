  "question": [
    "The variations of resistivity ρ with absolute temperature T for three different materials X, Y and Z are shown in the graph below. Identify the materials X, Y and Z.",
    "images/e3b6a935-7d8b-4a3d-9c4e-123456789025_1.png"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "X - copper, Y - semiconductor, Z - nichrome"
    ],
    [
      "X - semiconductor, Y - nichrome, Z - copper"
    ],
    [
      "X - nichrome, Y - copper, Z - semiconductor"
    ],
    [
      "X - copper, Y - nichrome, Z - semiconductor"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Graph X shows resistivity increasing non-linearly (typical for metals like Copper at low T).",
    "Graph Y shows resistivity increasing linearly but with a higher value/intercept (typical for alloys like Nichrome).",
    "Graph Z shows resistivity decreasing with temperature (typical for Semiconductors).",
