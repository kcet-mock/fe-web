  "question": [
    "The photoelectric work function for photo metal is 2.4 eV. Among the four wavelengths, the wavelength of light for which photo-emission does not take place is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "200 nm"
    ],
    [
      "300 nm"
    ],
    [
      "700 nm"
    ],
    [
      "400 nm"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Threshold wavelength $\\lambda_0 = hc/\\Phi \\approx 1240/2.4 \\approx 517$ nm.",
    "Photo-emission occurs only if $\\lambda < \\lambda_0$.",
    "700 nm is greater than 517 nm, so no emission occurs."
