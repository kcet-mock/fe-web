  "explanation": [
    "Let junction temp be T. Heat currents sum to zero.",
    "<katex>$\\frac{T-0}{R} + \\frac{T-90}{R} + \\frac{T-90}{R} = 0$</katex> (assuming flow direction or simple sum).",
    "Or Inflow = Outflow: Heat from 90 ends flows to 0 end. <katex>$\\frac{90-T}{R} + \\frac{90-T}{R} = \\frac{T-0}{R}$</katex>.",
    "<katex>$180 - 2T = T \\implies 3T = 180 \\implies T = 60^{\\circ}\\text{C}$</katex>."
