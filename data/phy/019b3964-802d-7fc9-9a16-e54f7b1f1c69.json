  "question": [
    "The total energy of a satellite in a circular orbit at a distance (R + h) from the centre of the Earth varies as [R is the radius of the Earth and h is the height of the orbit from Earth's surface]"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "-1 / (R + h)"
    ],
    [
      "1 / (R + h)²"
    ],
    [
      "-1 / (R + h)²"
    ],
    [
      "1 / (R + h)"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "The total energy of a satellite is given by E = -GMm / 2r.",
    "Here r = R + h.",
    "So, E = -GMm / 2(R + h), which varies as -1/(R + h).",
    "[cite: 134, 144]"
  ]
