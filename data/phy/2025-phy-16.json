  "question": [
    "A metallic sphere of radius R carrying a charge q is kept at certain distance from another metallic sphere of radius R/4 carrying a charge Q. What is the electric flux at any point inside the metallic sphere of radius R due to the sphere of radius R/4?",

  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "<katex>$\\frac{q}{\\epsilon_0}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "Zero"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$\\epsilon_0$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$\\frac{Q}{\\epsilon_0}$</katex>"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Inside a metallic (conducting) sphere, the electric field is zero due to electrostatic shielding.",
    "The field/flux contribution from external charges inside the conductor material or cavity is zero.",
    "Therefore, the flux is zero."
