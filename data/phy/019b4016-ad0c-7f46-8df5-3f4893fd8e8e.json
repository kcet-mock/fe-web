  "question": [
    "Which of the following combinations should be selected for better tuning of an LCR circuit used for communication?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "R=20 Ω, L=1.5 H, C=35 μF"
    ],
    [
      "R=25 Ω, L=2.5 H, C=45 μF"
    ],
    [
      "R=25 Ω, L=1.5 H, C=45 μF"
    ],
    [
      "R=15 Ω, L=3.5 H, C=30 μF"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Better tuning implies a higher Quality Factor (Q-factor).",
    "$Q = \\frac{1}{R}\\sqrt{\\frac{L}{C}}$.",
    "To maximize Q, we need low R, high L, and low C.",
    "Option (D) has the lowest R (15 Ω), highest L (3.5 H), and lowest C (30 μF), yielding the highest Q."
