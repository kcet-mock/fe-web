  "question": [
    "The graph between variation of resistance of a metal wire as a function of its diameter keeping other parameters like length and temperature constant is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Linear decreasing"
    ],
    [
      "Exponential increasing"
    ],
    [
      "Hyperbolic/Inverse Square decreasing"
    ],
    [
      "Linear increasing"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Resistance R = ρl/A = ρl / (π(D/2)²).",
    "R ∝ 1/D².",
    "The graph of R vs D is an inverse square curve (hyperbola-like decreasing slope).",
    "[cite: 439, 440]"
