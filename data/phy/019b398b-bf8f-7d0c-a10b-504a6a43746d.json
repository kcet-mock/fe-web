    "Three polaroid sheets are co-axially placed as indicated in the diagram. Pass axes of the polaroids 2 and 3 make 30° and 90° with pass axis of polaroid sheet 1. If I₀ is the intensity of the incident unpolarised light entering sheet 1, the intensity of the emergent light through sheet 3 is",

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Intensity after sheet 1: I₁ = I₀/2.",
    "After sheet 2 (angle 30°): I₂ = I₁ cos²(30°) = (I₀/2)(3/4) = 3I₀/8.",
    "Angle between sheet 2 and 3 is 90° - 30° = 60°.",
    "After sheet 3: I₃ = I₂ cos²(60°) = (3I₀/8)(1/4) = 3I₀/32."
