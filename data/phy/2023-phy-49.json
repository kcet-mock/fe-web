    "A parallel plate capacitor of capacitance <katex>$C_{1}$</katex> with a dielectric slab in between its plates is connected to a battery. It has a potential difference <katex>$V_{1}$</katex> across its plates. When the dielectric slab is removed, keeping the capacitor connected to the battery, the new capacitance and potential difference are <katex>$C_{2}$</katex> and <katex>$V_{2}$</katex> respectively. Then,"
