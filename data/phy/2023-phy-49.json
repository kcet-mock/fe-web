  "question": [
    "A parallel plate capacitor of capacitance <katex>$C_{1}$</katex> with a dielectric slab in between its plates is connected to a battery. It has a potential difference across its plates. When the dielectric slab is removed, keeping the capacitor connected to the battery, the new capacitance and potential difference are <katex>$C_{2}$</katex> and <katex>$V_{2}$</katex> respectively. Then,"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "<katex>$V_1 < V_2, C_1 > C_2$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$V_{1}=V_{2},C_{1}>C_{2}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$V_{1}=V_{2},C_{1}<C_{2}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$V_{1}>V_{2}$</katex>, <katex>$C_{1}>C_{2}$</katex>"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Since the battery remains connected, potential difference remains constant (<katex>$V_1 = V_2$</katex>). Removing the dielectric decreases capacitance (<katex>$C_1 > C_2$</katex>)."
