  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "The resonance frequency is given by <katex>$f_0 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\sqrt{LC}}$</katex>.",
    "This implies <katex>$f_0 \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{C}}$</katex>.",
    "As <katex>$C$</katex> increases, <katex>$f_0$</katex> decreases, but not linearly. The curve is a rectangular hyperbola type shape.",
    "Graph C correctly represents this inverse non-linear relationship."
