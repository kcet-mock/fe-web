  "question": [
    "A solid cube of mass m at a temperature θ₀ is heated at a constant rate. It becomes liquid at temperature θ₁ and vapour at temperature θ₂. Let s₁ and s₂ be specific heats in its solid and liquid states respectively. If Lf and Lv are latent heats of fusion and vaporisation respectively, then the minimum heat energy supplied to the cube until it vaporises is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "ms₁(θ₁ - θ₀) + ms₂(θ₂ - θ₁)"
    ],
    [
      "mLf + ms₂(θ₂ - θ₁) + mLv"
    ],
    [
      "ms₁(θ₁ - θ₀) + mLf + ms₂(θ₂ - θ₁) + mLv"
    ],
    [
      "ms₁(θ₁ - θ₀) + mLf + ms₂(θ₂ - θ₀) + mLv"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Total Heat = Heat to raise solid to MP + Latent Heat of Fusion + Heat to raise liquid to BP + Latent Heat of Vaporization.",
    "Q = ms₁(θ₁-θ₀) + mLf + ms₂(θ₂-θ₁) + mLv."
