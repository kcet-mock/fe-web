    "A uniform magnetic field of strength B = 2 mT exists vertically downwards. These magnetic field lines pass through a closed surface as shown in the figure. The closed surface consists of a hemisphere S₁, a right circular cone S₂ and a circular surface S₃. The magnetic flux through S₁ and S₂ are respectively",

    [
      "Φ_S1 = -20 μWb, Φ_S2 = +20 μWb"

    [
      "Φ_S1 = +20 μWb, Φ_S2 = -20 μWb"

    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "B is downwards. S1 is the top hemisphere (flux enters, so negative). S2 is the bottom cone (flux leaves, so positive).",
    "Magnitude = B × Area = 2 mT × πR² = 2×10⁻³ × π(10/√π)² × 10⁻⁴ = 20 μWb.",
    "So Φ_S1 = -20 μWb, Φ_S2 = +20 μWb."
