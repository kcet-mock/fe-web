  "question": [
    "Among the given pair of vectors, the resultant of two vectors can never be 3 units. The vectors are"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "1 unit and 2 units"
    ],
    [
      "2 units and 5 units"
    ],
    [

    ],
    [
      "4 units and 8 units"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "The resultant R of two vectors A and B lies in the range |A-B| ≤ R ≤ A+B.",
    "For pair (4, 8), range is [4, 12]. 3 is outside this range."
