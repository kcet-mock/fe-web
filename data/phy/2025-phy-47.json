  "question": [
    "The total energy carried by the light wave when it travels from a rarer to a non-reflecting and non-absorbing medium"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "remains same"
    ],
    [
      "increases"
    ],
    [
      "either increases or decreases depending upon angle of incidence"
    ],
    [
      "decreases"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Energy conservation applies. If there is no reflection or absorption, all energy is transmitted.",
    "Intensity might change due to area change, but total power/energy remains constant."
