  "question": [
    "A body of mass 10kg is kept on a horizontal surface. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the body and the surface is 0.5. A horizontal force of 60N is applied on the body. The resulting acceleration of the body is about"

  "choices": [
    [
      "$6ms^{-2}$"
    ],
    [
      "Zero"

    [
      "$1~ms^{-2}$"
    ],
    [
      "$5~ms^{-2}$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Friction $f = \\mu mg = 0.5 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 50N$.",
    "Net force $F_{net} = 60 - 50 = 10N$. Acceleration $a = 10/10 = 1 m/s^2$."
