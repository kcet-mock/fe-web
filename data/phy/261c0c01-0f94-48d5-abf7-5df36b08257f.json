    "Let junction temperature be <katex>$T_x$</katex>. Heat current flows from higher T to lower T.",
    "Assume current flows out from junction towards <katex>$0^{\\circ}$</katex> and in from <katex>$90^{\\circ}$</katex> ends.",
    "Kirchhoff's law for heat: <katex>$\\sum \\frac{\\Delta T}{R} = 0$</katex> or <katex>$\\text{Heat In} = \\text{Heat Out}$</katex>.",

    "<katex>$2(90-T_x) = T_x$</katex>",
