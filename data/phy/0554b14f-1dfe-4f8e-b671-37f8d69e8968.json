    "If AB is incident plane wave front then refracted wave front in (<katex>$n_2 > n_1$</katex>)",

  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "When travelling from rarer to denser medium (<katex>$n_2 > n_1$</katex>), the wave front bends such that the ray bends towards the normal. The refracted wavefront will be tilted closer to the interface plane compared to incident."
