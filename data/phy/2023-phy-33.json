    "The moment of inertia of a rigid body about an axis"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Depends on the positions of axis of rotation"
    ],
    [
      "Does not depend on its size"
    ],
    [
      "Does not depend on its mass"
    ],
    [
      "Does not depend on its shape"
    ]

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Moment of inertia <katex>$I = \\sum mr^2$</katex> depends on mass, distribution of mass (shape/size), and the position/orientation of the axis of rotation."
