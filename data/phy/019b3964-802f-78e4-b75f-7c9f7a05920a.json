  "question": [
    "Two cells of emfs E₁ and E₂ and internal resistances r₁ and r₂ (E₂ > E₁ and r₂ > r₁) respectively, are connected in parallel as shown in figure. The equivalent emf of the combination is Eeq. Then"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "E₁ < Eeq < E₂ and Eeq is nearer E₂"
    ],
    [
      "Eeq > E₂"
    ],
    [
      "Eeq < E₁"
    ],
    [
      "E₁ < Eeq < E₂ and Eeq is nearer E₁"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "The equivalent emf for parallel combination is E_eq = (E₁/r₁ + E₂/r₂) / (1/r₁ + 1/r₂).",
    "This represents a weighted average of E₁ and E₂.",
    "Since r₂ > r₁, the term 1/r₁ > 1/r₂, meaning E₁ has a greater weight in the average.",
    "Therefore, E_eq will be closer to E₁.",
