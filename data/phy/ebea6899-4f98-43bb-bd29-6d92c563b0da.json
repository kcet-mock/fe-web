  "question": [
    "A particle is in uniform circular motion. The equation of its trajectory is given by <katex>$(x-2)^2 + y^2 = 25$</katex>, where x and y are in meter. The speed of the particle is <katex>$2\\text{ ms}^{-1}$</katex>, when the particle attains the lowest 'y' co-ordinate, the acceleration of the particle is (in <katex>$\\text{ms}^{-2}$</katex>)"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "<katex>$0.4\\hat{j}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$0.8\\hat{i}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$0.8\\hat{j}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$0.4\\hat{i}$</katex>"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Center is (2, 0). Radius R = 5.",
    "Lowest point is (2, -5).",
    "Acceleration is centripetal, directed towards center (2, 0). Direction is <katex>$+\\hat{j}$</katex>.",
    "Magnitude <katex>$a = v^2/R = 2^2/5 = 0.8$</katex>.",
    "Vector acceleration <katex>$\\vec{a} = 0.8\\hat{j}$</katex>."
