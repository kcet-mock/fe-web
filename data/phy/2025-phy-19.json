  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "For a conducting sphere, the electric field inside (<katex>$r < R$</katex>) is zero.",
    "Outside the sphere (<katex>$r \\ge R$</katex>), <katex>$E = \\frac{kQ}{r^2}$</katex>, so E decreases as <katex>$1/r^2$</katex>.",
    "The graph must show E=0 until r=R, then a sudden jump and a decay. This corresponds to graph (1)."
