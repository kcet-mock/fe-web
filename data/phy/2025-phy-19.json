  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "For a conducting sphere, the electric field inside (<katex>$r < R$</katex>) is zero.",
    "Outside (<katex>$r \\ge R$</katex>), the field behaves as <katex>$E \\propto \\frac{1}{r^2}$</katex>.",
    "Graph 1 shows E=0 until r=R, then decreasing, which is correct."
