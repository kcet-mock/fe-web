  "choices": [
    [
      "Induced electric current is zero"
    ],
    [
      "Induced electric current is anticlockwise"
    ],
    [
      "Induced electric current is clockwise"
    ],
    [
      "Ring will come to rest"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "As the ring falls towards the wire, the magnetic field through it increases.",
    "According to Lenz's law, the induced current will create a field to oppose this increase.",
    "Based on the configuration (Ring on left/right and current direction), if the Key is C (Clockwise), it implies the induced field is into the page (if B is out) or similar opposing mechanism."
