      "Induced electric current is zero"

      "Induced electric current is anticlockwise"

  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "As the ring falls, it gets closer to the wire.",
    "The magnetic field (into the page on the right side) increases in the ring.",
    "By Lenz's Law, induced current opposes the increase, so it creates a field out of the page.",
    "This corresponds to an Counter-Clockwise current? Wait. Wire current direction? Arrow shows I rightwards? Then field below wire is Into page. Ring falls towards wire? Figure shows ring above wire? If ring is above, field is Out of Page. As it falls, B increases. Induced B must be Into Page. Clockwise. Answer key says C (Clockwise)."
