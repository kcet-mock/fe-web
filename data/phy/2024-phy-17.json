    "The ratio of area of first excited state to ground state of orbit of hydrogen atom is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "1:16"
    ],
    [
      "1:4"
    ],
    [
      "4:1"
    ],
    [
      "16:1"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Radius of orbit <katex>$r_n \\propto n^2$</katex>.",
    "Area of orbit <katex>$A \\propto r^2 \\propto (n^2)^2 = n^4$</katex>.",
    "For ground state, <katex>$n=1, A_1 \\propto 1$</katex>.",
    "For first excited state, <katex>$n=2, A_2 \\propto 2^4 = 16$</katex>.",
    "Ratio <katex>$A_2 : A_1 = 16:1$</katex>.",
    "(Note: The official key is C (4:1), which corresponds to the ratio of radii <katex>$n^2$</katex> or circumference, but the question asks for area)."
