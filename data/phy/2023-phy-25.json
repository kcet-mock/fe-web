    "A full-wave rectifier with diodes <katex>$D_{1}$</katex> and <katex>$D_{2}$</katex> is used to rectify 50 Hz alternating voltage. The diode <katex>$D_{1}$</katex> conducts times in one second."

  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "In a full-wave rectifier, <katex>$D_1$</katex> conducts during the positive half cycles and <katex>$D_2$</katex> during negative half cycles. For a 50 Hz AC, there are 50 positive half cycles per second. Thus <katex>$D_1$</katex> conducts 50 times."
