  "question": [
    "A gas is taken from state A to state B along two different paths 1 and 2. The heat absorbed and work done by the system along these two paths are Q₁ and Q₂ and W₁ and W₂ respectively. Then"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "W₁ = W₂"
    ],
    [
      "Q₁ - W₁ = Q₂ - W₂"
    ],
    [
      "Q₁ + W₁ = Q₂ + W₂"
    ],
    [
      "Q₁ = Q₂"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "According to the First Law of Thermodynamics, ΔU = Q - W.",
    "The change in internal energy ΔU depends only on the initial and final states, not the path.",
    "Since both paths connect state A to state B, ΔU₁ = ΔU₂.",
    "Therefore, Q₁ - W₁ = Q₂ - W₂.",
