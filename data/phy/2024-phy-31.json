  "question": [
    "A body of mass 1 kg is suspended by a weightless string which passes over a frictionless pulley of mass 2 kg as shown in the figure. The mass is released from a height of 1.6 m from the ground. With what velocity does it strike the ground?",

    [
      "<katex>$16~ms^{-1}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$8~ms^{-1}$</katex>"
    ],
    [

    [
      "<katex>$4~ms^{-1}$</katex>"

  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Using conservation of energy or dynamics. Note the pulley has mass.",
    "If we treat the pulley as a disk (Mass M=2kg) and block (m=1kg).",
    "Loss in PE = Gain in Trans KE + Gain in Rot KE? Or is it a simple Atwood? The diagram shows the string fixed at one end, pulley moving? No, diagram shows pulley fixed? 'Pulley of mass 2kg'.",
    "Using standard result <katex>$v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2gh}{1 + M/2m}}$</katex> for massive pulley? No, string passes over. If fixed pulley: <katex>$v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2gh}{1+I/mR^2}}$</katex>. <katex>$I = MR^2/2$</katex>. <katex>$v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2gh}{1 + M/2m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2(10)(1.6)}{1 + 2/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{32}{2}} = 4$</katex> m/s."
