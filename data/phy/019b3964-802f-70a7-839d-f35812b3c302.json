  "question": [
    "Two thin long parallel wires separated by a distance ‘r’ from each other in vacuum carry a current of I ampere in opposite directions. Then, they will"

  "choices": [
    [
      "Attract each other with a force per unit length of μ₀I² / 2πr"
    ],
    [
      "Repel each other with a force per unit length of μ₀I² / 2πr"
    ],

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Currents in opposite directions repel each other.",
    "Force per unit length is given by F/l = μ₀I₁I₂ / 2πr.",
    "Since I₁ = I₂ = I, F/l = μ₀I² / 2πr.",
