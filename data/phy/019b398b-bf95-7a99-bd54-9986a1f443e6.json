  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Induced electric current is zero"
    ],
    [
      "Induced electric current is anticlockwise"
    ],
    [
      "Induced electric current is clockwise"
    ],
    [
      "Ring will come to rest"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "As the ring falls towards the wire, the magnetic flux through it increases.",
    "According to Lenz's law, the induced current creates a field to oppose this increase.",
    "For a wire carrying current to the right, the B field above is out of the page. The induced field must be into the page, which requires a clockwise current."
