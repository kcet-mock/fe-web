    "A block of certain mass is placed on a rough floor. The coefficients of static and kinetic friction between the block and the floor are 0.4 and 0.25 respectively. A constant horizontal force <katex>$F=20$</katex> N acts on it so that the velocity of the block varies with time according to the following graph. The mass of the block is nearly (Take <katex>$g=10 ms^{-2}$</katex>)",

  "explanation": [
    "From the v-t graph, acceleration <katex>$a = \\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{20 - 0}{3 - 0} = \\frac{20}{3} m/s^2$</katex>.",
    "Since the block is moving, kinetic friction acts.",
    "Equation of motion: <katex>$F - f_k = ma$</katex>",
    "<katex>$20 - \\mu_k mg = ma$</katex>",
    "<katex>$20 - 0.25(m)(10) = m(\\frac{20}{3})$</katex>",
    "<katex>$20 - 2.5m = 6.67m$</katex>",
    "<katex>$20 = 9.17m \\Rightarrow m \\approx 2.2$</katex> kg."
