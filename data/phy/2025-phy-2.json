  "question": [
    "A block of certain mass is placed on a rough floor. The coefficients of static and kinetic friction between the block and the floor are 0.4 and 0.25 respectively. A constant horizontal force <katex>$F=20$</katex> N acts on it so that the velocity of the block varies with time according to the following graph. The mass of the block is nearly (Take <katex>$g=10~ms^{-2}$</katex>)",

  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "From the graph, acceleration <katex>$a = \\frac{v-u}{t} = \\frac{20-0}{3} = \\frac{20}{3} m/s^2$</katex>.",
    "Since the block is moving, kinetic friction acts on it.",
    "Equation of motion: <katex>$F - f_k = ma$</katex>",
    "<katex>$F - \\mu_k mg = ma$</katex>",
    "<katex>$20 - 0.25 \\times m \\times 10 = m \\times \\frac{20}{3}$</katex>",
    "<katex>$20 - 2.5m = 6.67m$</katex>",
    "<katex>$20 = 9.17m$</katex>",
    "<katex>$m \\approx 2.2$</katex> kg"
