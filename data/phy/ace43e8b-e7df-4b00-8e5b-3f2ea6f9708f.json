  "question": [
    "The photoelectric work function for photo metal is 2.4 eV. Among the four wavelengths, the wavelength of light for which photo-emission does not take place is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "200 nm"
    ],
    [
      "300 nm"
    ],
    [
      "700 nm"
    ],
    [
      "400 nm"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Threshold wavelength <katex>$\\lambda_0 = \\frac{1240}{\\phi (eV)} = \\frac{1240}{2.4} \\approx 516$</katex> nm.",
    "Photo-emission occurs only if incident wavelength <katex>$\\lambda \\le \\lambda_0$</katex>.",
    "Among the options, 700 nm > 516 nm, so no emission occurs for 700 nm."
