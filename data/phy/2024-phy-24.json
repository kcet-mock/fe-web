  "question": [
    "A p-n junction diode is connected to a battery of emf 5.7 V in series with a resistance 5 <katex>$\\Omega$</katex> (or k<katex>$\\Omega$</katex>) such that it is forward biased. If the barrier potential of the diode is 0.7 V, neglecting the diode resistance, the current in the circuit is"

  "choices": [
    [
      "1.14 mA"
    ],
    [
      "1 mA"
    ],
    [
      "1 A"
    ],
    [
      "1.14 A"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Net voltage <katex>$V = 5.7 - 0.7 = 5.0$</katex> V.",
    "Given the answer choices, the resistance is likely 5 k<katex>$\\Omega$</katex>.",
    "Current <katex>$I = \\frac{V}{R} = \\frac{5}{5000} = 10^{-3}$</katex> A = 1 mA."
