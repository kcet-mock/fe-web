  "question": [
    "For a given pair of transparent media, the critical angle for which colour is maximum?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Blue"
    ],
    [
      "Violet"
    ],
    [
      "Green"
    ],
    [
      "Red"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": [
    "Critical angle <katex>$\\sin C = 1/n$</katex>. Refractive index <katex>$n$</katex> is lowest for Red light and highest for Violet light (Cauchy's equation). Since <katex>$n$</katex> is lowest for Red, <katex>$\\sin C$</katex> is highest, so the critical angle is maximum for Red."
