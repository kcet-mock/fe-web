  "question": [
    "Given, a current carrying wire of non-uniform cross-section, which of the following is constant throughout the length of wire?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Drift speed"
    ],
    [
      "Current and drift speed"
    ],
    [
      "Current only"
    ],
    [
      "Current, electric field and drift speed"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "In a series circuit (or single wire), conservation of charge dictates that the current (I) must be the same at all cross-sections.",
    "Drift velocity <katex>$v_d = I/(nAq)$</katex> depends on Area A, so it varies.",
    "Electric field E also depends on A.",
    "Only Current is constant."
