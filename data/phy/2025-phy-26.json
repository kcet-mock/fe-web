  "question": [
    "Given, a current carrying wire of non-uniform cross-section, which of the following is constant throughout the length of wire?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Drift speed"
    ],
    [
      "Current and drift speed"
    ],
    [
      "Current only"
    ],
    [
      "Current, electric field and drift speed"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "In a series circuit (the wire), charge is conserved, so Current (I) is constant.",
    "Drift speed <katex>$v_d = I / (nAe)$</katex> depends on Area.",
    "Electric field <katex>$E = J/\\sigma$</katex> depends on Area.",
    "Only Current is constant."
