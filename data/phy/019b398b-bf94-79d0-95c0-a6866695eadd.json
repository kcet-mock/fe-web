  "question": [
    "An electric bulb of 60 W, 120 V is to be connected to 220 V source. What resistance should be connected in series with the bulb, so that the bulb glows properly ?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "50 Ω"
    ],
    [
      "100 Ω"
    ],
    [
      "200 Ω"
    ],
    [
      "288 Ω"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Rated Current I = P/V = 60/120 = 0.5 A.",
    "Resistance of bulb Rb = 120/0.5 = 240 Ω.",
    "Total Resistance needed for 220V = 220/0.5 = 440 Ω.",
    "Series Resistance R = 440 - 240 = 200 Ω."
  ]
