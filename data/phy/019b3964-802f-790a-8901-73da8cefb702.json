  "question": [
    "Two similar galvanometers are converted into an ammeter and a milliammeter. The shunt resistance of ammeter as compared to the shunt resistance of milliammeter will be"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Zero"
    ],
    [
      "More"
    ],
    [
      "Less"
    ],
    [
      "Equal"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Shunt Resistance S = I_g G / (I - I_g).",
    "An ammeter measures larger current (I) compared to a milliammeter.",
    "As current range I increases, the denominator (I - I_g) increases, so S decreases.",
    "Therefore, the ammeter has less shunt resistance.",
    "[cite: 450, 451, 452]"
