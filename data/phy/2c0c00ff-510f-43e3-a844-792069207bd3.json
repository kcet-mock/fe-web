    "Which of the following statements is correct for an n-type semiconductor?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "The donor energy level lies closely above the top of the valance band"
    ],
    [
      "The donor energy level lies at the half way mark of forbidden energy gap"
    ],
    [
      "The donor energy level does not exist"
    ],
    [
      "The donor energy level lies just below the bottom of the conduction band"
    ]
