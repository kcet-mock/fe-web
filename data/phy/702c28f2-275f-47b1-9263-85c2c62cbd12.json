  "question": [
    "Under electrostatic condition of a charged conductor, which among the following statements is true?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "The electric field on the surface of a charged conductor is <katex>$\\frac{\\sigma}{2\\epsilon_{0}}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "The electric potential inside a charged conductor is always zero"
    ],
    [
      "Any excess charge resides on the surface of the conductor"
    ],
    [
      "The net electric field is tangential to the surface of the conductor"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "A: Field is <katex>$\\sigma / \\epsilon_0$</katex>. B: Potential is constant, not necessarily zero. D: Field is normal to the surface.",
    "C: True. In electrostatics, excess charge resides on the outer surface."
