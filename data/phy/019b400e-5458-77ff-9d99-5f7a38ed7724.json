      "Graph 1 (Zero inside, decreasing outside)"
    ],

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "For a conducting sphere, the electric field inside ($r < R$) is zero.",
    "Outside the sphere ($r \\ge R$), it behaves like a point charge: $E \\propto 1/r^2$.",
    "Graph 1 correctly depicts $E=0$ up to $R$, then a $1/r^2$ decay."
