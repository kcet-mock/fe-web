    "When light propagates through a given homogeneous medium, the velocities of"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Primary wavefronts are greater than or equal to those of secondary wavelets."
    ],
    [
      "Primary wavefronts and wavelets are equal"
    ],
    [
      "Primary wavefronts are larger than those of secondary wavelets"
    ],
    [
      "Primary wavefronts are lesser than those of secondary wavelets"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "According to Huygens' principle, secondary wavelets spread out with the speed of light in that medium, which is the same as the speed of propagation of the primary wavefront."
