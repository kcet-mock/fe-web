  "question": [
    "Vector E is the electric field inside a conductor whose material has conductivity σ and resistivity ρ. The current density inside the conductor is vector j. The correct form of Ohm’s law is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "E = σ j"
    ],
    [
      "j = ρ E"
    ],
    [
      "E = ρ j"
    ],
    [
      "E = j . ρ"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Microscopic form of Ohm's law: j = σE.",
    "Since ρ = 1/σ, we have j = E/ρ, or E = ρj."
