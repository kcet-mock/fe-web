  "question": [
    "The magnetic field at the centre of a circular coil of radius R carrying current I is 64 times the magnetic field at a distance x on its axis from the centre of the coil. Then the value of x is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "R / √15"
    ],
    [
      "R√3"
    ],
    [
      "R / 4"
    ],
    [
      "R√15"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "B_center / B_axis = (1 + x²/R²)^(3/2) = 64.",
    "1 + x²/R² = (64)^(2/3) = 16.",
    "x²/R² = 15 => x = R√15."
  ]
