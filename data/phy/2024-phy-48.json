  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "<katex>$\\frac{V_{0}}{R}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$\\frac{2V_{0}}{R}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$\\frac{3V_{0}}{R}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$\\frac{V_{0}}{3R}$</katex>"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": [
    "The circuit consists of two balanced Wheatstone bridges in series.",
    "Left bridge equivalent resistance = R. Right bridge equivalent resistance = 2R.",
    "Total Resistance = R + 2R = 3R.",
    "Current <katex>$I = \\frac{V_0}{3R}$</katex>."
