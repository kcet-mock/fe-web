    "The figure shows variation of R, <katex>$X_{L}$</katex> and <katex>$X_{C}$</katex> with frequency 'f' in a series LCR circuit. Then for what frequency point is the circuit capacitive?",

  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "The circuit is capacitive when <katex>$X_C > X_L$</katex>.",
    "In the graph, <katex>$X_C$</katex> is the curve decreasing with frequency, and <katex>$X_L$</katex> is the line increasing with frequency.",
    "At point A (low frequency), the value of <katex>$X_C$</katex> is higher than <katex>$X_L$</katex>. Thus, the circuit is capacitive at point A."
