    "The figure shows variation of R, <katex>$X_{L}$</katex> and <katex>$X_{C}$</katex> with frequency 'f' in a series LCR circuit. Then for what frequency point is the circuit capacitive?",

  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "A circuit is capacitive when the capacitive reactance <katex>$X_C$</katex> is greater than the inductive reactance <katex>$X_L$</katex>.",
    "From the graph, <katex>$X_C$</katex> (the decreasing curve) is greater than <katex>$X_L$</katex> (the increasing line) at frequencies lower than the resonance frequency.",
    "Point A lies in the region where <katex>$X_C > X_L$</katex>."
