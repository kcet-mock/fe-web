  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "For a conducting sphere, the electric field inside (<katex>$r < R$</katex>) is zero.",
    "Outside (<katex>$r \\ge R$</katex>), the field acts as if all charge is at the center: <katex>$E \\propto 1/r^2$</katex>.",
    "Thus, the graph is zero up to <katex>$r=R$</katex>, then jumps to a maximum and decreases hyperbolically."
