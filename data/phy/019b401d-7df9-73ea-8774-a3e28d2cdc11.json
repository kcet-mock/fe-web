  "question": [
    "In series LCR circuit at resonance, the phase difference between voltage and current is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "$\\frac{\\pi}{4}$"
    ],
    [
      "$\\frac{\\pi}{2}$"
    ],
    [
      "Zero"
    ],
    [
      "$\\pi$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "At resonance, the circuit is purely resistive ($X_L = X_C$), so voltage and current are in phase."
