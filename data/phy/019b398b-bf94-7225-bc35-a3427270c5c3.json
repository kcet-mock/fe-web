  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Slope of I-V is 1/R. 400°C corresponds to lower slope (higher R, 30°). 100°C corresponds to higher slope (lower R, 45°).",
    "R₁ (100°C) ∝ cot(45°) = 1. R₂ (400°C) ∝ cot(30°) = √3.",
    "√3 = 1(1 + α(300)) => 0.732 = 300α => α ≈ 2.44 × 10⁻³. Closest option is 3 × 10⁻³."
