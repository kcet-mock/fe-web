  "question": [
    "An athlete runs along a circular track of diameter 80 m. The distance travelled and the magnitude of displacement of the athlete when he covers $\\frac{3}{4}$ of the circle is (in m)"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "60π, $40\\sqrt{2}$"
    ],
    [
      "40π, $60\\sqrt{2}$"
    ],
    [

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Radius $R = 40$ m.",
    "Distance = $\\frac{3}{4} (2\\pi R) = \\frac{3}{2}\\pi(40) = 60\\pi$.",
    "Displacement = Chord length = $\\sqrt{R^2 + R^2} = 40\\sqrt{2}$."
