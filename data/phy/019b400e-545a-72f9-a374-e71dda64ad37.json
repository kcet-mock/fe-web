    [
      "Deflects towards X'"
    ],
    [
      "Does not deflect"

      "Oscillates"
    ],
    [
      "Deflects towards X"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "According to Lenz's Law, the induced current opposes the change in flux.",
    "Pushing towards creates a certain flux change direction (deflection X).",
    "Pulling away creates the opposite flux change, so the current direction reverses, deflecting towards X'."
