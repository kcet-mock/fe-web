  "question": [
    "In the Young's double slit experiment, the intensity of light passing through each of the two double slits is $2\\times10^{-2}Wm^{-2}$. The screen-slit distance is very large in comparison with slit-slit distance. The fringe width is $\\beta$. The distance between the central maximum and a point P on the screen is $x=\\frac{\\beta}{3}.$ Then the total light intensity at that point is"

    "Path difference $\\Delta x = \\frac{x d}{D} = \\frac{\\lambda}{3}$. Phase difference $\\phi = \\frac{2\\pi}{3} = 120^{\\circ}$.",
    "Resultant Intensity $I = 4I_0 \\cos^2(\\phi/2) = 4I_0 \\cos^2(60) = I_0$."
