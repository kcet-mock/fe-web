  "question": [
    "The Curie temperatures of Cobalt and iron are 1400K and 1000 K respectively. At $T=1600K$, the ratio of magnetic susceptibility of Cobalt to that of iron is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "$\\frac{7}{5}$"
    ],
    [
      "$\\frac{5}{7}$"
    ],
    [
      "$\\frac{1}{3}$"
    ],
    [
      "3"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "From Curie-Weiss law, $\\chi \\propto \\frac{1}{T - T_c}$.",
    "Ratio $\\frac{\\chi_{Co}}{\\chi_{Fe}} = \\frac{1600-1000}{1600-1400} = \\frac{600}{200} = 3$."
