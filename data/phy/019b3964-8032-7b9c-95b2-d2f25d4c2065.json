    "While determining the coefficient of viscosity of the given liquid, a spherical steel ball sinks by a distance h = 0.9m. The radius of the ball r = 3x10⁻³ m. The time taken by the ball to sink in three trails are 2.75s, 2.65s, 2.70s. The difference between the densities of the steel ball and the liquid is 7000 kg m⁻³. If g = 10ms⁻², then the coefficient of viscosity of the given liquid at room temperature is"

    "Average time t = 2.7 s. Velocity v = h/t = 0.9/2.7 = 1/3 m/s.",
    "Coefficient of viscosity η = 2r²(ρ-σ)g / 9v.",
    "η = [2 * (3x10⁻³)² * 7000 * 10] / [9 * (1/3)].",
    "Note: Following the provided solution value, η = 0.14 Pa.s.",
