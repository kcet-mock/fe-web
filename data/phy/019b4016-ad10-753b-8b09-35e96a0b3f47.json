  "question": [
    "Under electrostatic condition of a charged conductor, which among the following statements is true?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "The electric field on the surface of a charged conductor is $\\frac{\\sigma}{2\\epsilon_{0}}$"
    ],
    [
      "The electric potential inside a charged conductor is always zero"
    ],
    [
      "Any excess charge resides on the surface of the conductor"
    ],
    [
      "The net electric field is tangential to the surface of the conductor"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "In electrostatics, any excess charge placed on a conductor moves entirely to its outer surface to minimize repulsion and ensure zero field inside."
