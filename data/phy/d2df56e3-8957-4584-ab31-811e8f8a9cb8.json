    "images/q25_graph.png"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "X copper, Y - semiconductor, Z - nichrome"
    ],
    [
      "X-semiconductor, Y-nichrome, Z copper"
    ],
    [
      "X-nichrome, Y copper, Z - semiconductor"
    ],
    [
      "X copper, Y - nichrome, Z - semiconductor"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Graph X shows linear increase at higher T (Metal/Copper).",
    "Graph Y shows weak dependence (Alloy/Nichrome).",
    "Graph Z shows decrease with T (Semiconductor).",
    "Therefore: X-Copper, Y-Nichrome, Z-Semiconductor."
