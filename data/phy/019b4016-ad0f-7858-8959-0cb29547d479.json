  "question": [
    "Water flows through a horizontal pipe of varying cross-section at a rate of $0.314~m^{3}s^{-1}$. The velocity of water at a point where the radius of the pipe is 10 cm is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "$0.1~ms^{-1}$"
    ],
    [
      "$1~ms^{-1}$"
    ],
    [
      "$10~ms^{-1}$"
    ],
    [
      "$100~ms^{-1}$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Flow rate $Q = Av$. Area $A = \\pi r^2 = 3.14 \\times (0.1)^2 = 0.0314 m^2$.",
    "$v = Q/A = 0.314 / 0.0314 = 10$ m/s."
