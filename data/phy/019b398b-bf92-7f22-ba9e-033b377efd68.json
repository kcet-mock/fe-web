  "question": [
    "A thick metal wire of density ρ and length 'L' is hung from a rigid support. The increase in length of the wire due to its own weight is (Y = Young's modulus of the material of the wire)"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "ρgL / Y"
    ],
    [
      "ρgL² / 2Y"
    ],
    [
      "ρgL² / Y"
    ],
    [
      "ρgL² / 4Y"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Elongation due to self-weight ΔL = (MgL) / (2AY).",
    "Mass M = ρAL.",
    "ΔL = (ρAL × g × L) / (2AY) = ρgL² / 2Y."
