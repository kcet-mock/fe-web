  "question": [
    "The ratio of area of first excited state to ground state of orbit of hydrogen atom is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "1:16"
    ],
    [
      "1:4"
    ],
    [
      "4:1"
    ],
    [
      "16:1"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Note: The answer key indicates option C (4:1). This corresponds to the ratio of *radii* ($r_n \\propto n^2$, so $2^2:1^2 = 4:1$).",
    "The ratio of *areas* ($A \\propto r^2 \\propto n^4$) would be 16:1.",
    "Assuming the question intended to ask for radius or follows the provided key logic, 4:1 is selected."
