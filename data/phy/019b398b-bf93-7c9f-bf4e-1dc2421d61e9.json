  "question": [
    "A uniform electric field E = 3 × 10⁵ NC⁻¹ is acting along the positive Y-axis. The electric flux through a rectangle of area 10 cm × 30 cm whose plane is parallel to the Z-X plane is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "12 × 10³ Vm"
    ],
    [
      "9 × 10³ Vm"
    ],
    [
      "15 × 10³ Vm"
    ],
    [
      "18 × 10³ Vm"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Area A = 0.1 m × 0.3 m = 0.03 m².",
    "The plane is parallel to Z-X, so the area vector is along the Y-axis (parallel to E).",
    "Flux Φ = E × A = (3 × 10⁵) × 0.03 = 9 × 10³ Vm."
