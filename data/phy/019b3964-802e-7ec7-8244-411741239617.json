  "question": [
    "Charges are uniformly spread on the surface of a conducting sphere. The electric field from the centre of sphere to a point outside the sphere varies with distance r from the centre as"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Graph 1: Zero up to R, then decreases as 1/r²"
    ],
    [
      "Graph 2: Linear decrease"
    ],
    [
      "Graph 3: Decreasing curve from origin"
    ],
    [
      "Graph 4: Linear increase"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "For a conducting sphere, the electric field inside (r < R) is zero.",
    "Outside the sphere (r ≥ R), the field behaves as if all charge is at the center: E = kQ/r².",
    "The graph is 0 until r=R, then decays as 1/r².",
