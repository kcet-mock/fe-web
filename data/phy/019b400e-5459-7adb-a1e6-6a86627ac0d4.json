    "Two similar galvanometers are covered into an ammeter and a milliammeter. The shunt resistance of ammeter as compared to the shunt resistance of milliammeter will be"

    [
      "Zero"
    ],
    [
      "More"

  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Shunt resistance $S = \\frac{I_g G}{I - I_g}$.",
    "For an Ammeter, the range $I$ is large (e.g., 1A).",
    "For a Milliammeter, the range $I$ is small (e.g., 1mA).",
    "Since $S$ is inversely proportional to $(I - I_g)$, a larger range ($I$) requires a smaller shunt resistance."
