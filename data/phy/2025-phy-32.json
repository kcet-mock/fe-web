    "Identify the correct statement"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "A current carrying conductor produces an electric field around it"
    ],
    [
      "A straight current carrying conductor has circular magnetic field lines around it"
    ],
    [
      "The direction of magnetic field due to a current element is given by Flemings Left Hand Rule"
    ],
    [
      "The magnetic field inside a solenoid is non-uniform"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "A stationary current carrying wire is electrically neutral, so E=0 outside.",
    "The magnetic field lines around a straight current carrying wire form concentric circles (Right Hand Thumb Rule).",
    "Field inside a long solenoid is uniform."
