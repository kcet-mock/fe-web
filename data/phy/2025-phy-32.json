    "Identify the correct statement"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "A current carrying conductor produces an electric field around it."
    ],
    [
      "A straight current carrying conductor has circular magnetic field lines around it."
    ],
    [
      "The direction of magnetic field due to a current element is given by Flemings Left Hand Rule"
    ],
    [
      "The magnetic field inside a solenoid is non-uniform"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "A straight current-carrying conductor produces magnetic field lines in the form of concentric circles (Right Hand Thumb Rule).",
    "Statement 1 is false (wire is neutral).",
    "Statement 3 is false (Field direction is by Right Hand Rule).",
    "Statement 4 is false (Field inside solenoid is uniform)."
