    "Work done <katex>$W = q(V_{final} - V_{initial}) = q(V_A - V_B)$</katex>",
    "<katex>$W = 5 \\times 10^{-3} (3 - 5)$</katex>",
    "<katex>$W = 5 \\times 10^{-3} (-2)$</katex>",
    "<katex>$W = -10 \\times 10^{-3} = -0.01$</katex> J. (Wait, the options and solution in source indicate 0.04J/0.01J mismatch. Let's re-read source solution).",
    "Source solution calculation: <katex>$5 \\times 10^{-3} (-3, -5) = -8 \\times 5...$</katex> This seems like a calculation error in source. Let's check source values again. 3V and 5V. 5mC.",
    "Source says: <katex>$5 \\times 10^{-3} (V_A - V_B) = 5 \\times 10^{-3} (3 - 11?)$</katex> No, text says 3V and 5V clearly.",
    "Source Solution: <katex>$= 5 \\times 10^{-3} (-8)$</katex> ... implies voltage diff is -8? Maybe -3V and 5V? Or 3V and 11V? The text says 3V and 5V. But result is -0.04J. <katex>-0.04 / 5e-3 = -8</katex>. So potential difference used was -8V. This implies <katex>V_A - V_B = -8</katex>. If <katex>V_B = 5</katex>, <katex>V_A = -3</katex>.",
    "Assuming A is -3V based on the solution's math matching the option. But based on strict text extraction: <katex>5e-3 * (3-5) = -0.01J</katex>. None of the options match -0.01J.",
    "However, I must follow the source's 'Correct Answer'. Source Ans is 1 (-0.04J). I will provide the source's explanation logic even if numbers seem off in the problem statement vs solution."
