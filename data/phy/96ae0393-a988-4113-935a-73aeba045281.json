  "question": [
    "When a planet revolves around the Sun, in general, for the planet"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Kinetic and potential energy of the planet are constant."
    ],
    [
      "Angular momentum about the Sun and aerial velocity of the planet are constant."
    ],
    [
      "Linear momentum and linear velocity are constant."
    ],
    [
      "Linear momentum and aerial velocity are constant."
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "According to Kepler's Second Law, the areal velocity is constant.",
    "This implies the conservation of angular momentum about the Sun, as the gravitational force is central (torque is zero)."
