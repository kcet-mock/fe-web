  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "The resonance frequency is given by <katex>$f_0 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sqrt{LC}}$</katex>.",
    "This implies <katex>$f_0 \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{C}}$</katex>.",
    "The graph of <katex>$f_0$</katex> versus <katex>$C$</katex> is a rectangular hyperbola-like curve where <katex>$f_0$</katex> decreases as <katex>$C$</katex> increases, which corresponds to graph (C)."
