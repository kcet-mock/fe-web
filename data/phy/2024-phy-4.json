  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Resonance frequency is given by <katex>$f_0 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sqrt{LC}}$</katex>.",
    "This implies <katex>$f_0 \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{C}}$</katex>.",
    "The graph of <katex>$f_0$</katex> vs <katex>$C$</katex> will be a curve that decreases as C increases, similar to a rectangular hyperbola but sharper. Graph (C) correctly represents this inverse relationship."
