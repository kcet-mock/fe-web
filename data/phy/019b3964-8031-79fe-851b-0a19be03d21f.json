  "question": [
    "If r and r1 denotes the angles inside the prism having angle of prism 50° considering that during interval of time from t = 0 to t = t, r varies with time as r = 10 + t. During the time r1 will vary with time as"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "40 + t"
    ],
    [
      "50 - t"
    ],
    [
      "50 + t"
    ],
    [
      "40 - t"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "For a prism, A = r + r1.",
    "50 = (10 + t) + r1.",
    "r1 = 50 - 10 - t = 40 - t.",
    "[cite: 497, 498, 499]"
