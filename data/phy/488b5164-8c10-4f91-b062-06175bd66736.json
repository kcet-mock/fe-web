  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Photo current is zero below threshold frequency <katex>$\\nu_0$</katex>.",
    "Above <katex>$\\nu_0$</katex>, assuming constant intensity, the saturation current is roughly constant (or rises if intensity distribution changes, but standard model with fixed intensity suggests step or rise). The answer key selects graph 1."
