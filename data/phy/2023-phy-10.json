  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "As the loop enters, flux increases, inducing negative EMF (by Lenz's law logic or coordinate convention). Once fully inside (from t=1s to t=5s given dimensions), flux is constant, EMF is zero. As it exits, flux decreases, inducing positive EMF. The graph shows a negative pulse, then zero, then a positive pulse."
