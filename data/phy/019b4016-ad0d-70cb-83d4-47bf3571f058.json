  "question": [
    "In alpha particle scattering experiment, if v is the initial velocity of the particle, then the distance of closest approach is d. If the velocity is doubled, then the distance of closest approach becomes"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "4d"
    ],
    [
      "2d"
    ],
    [
      "$\\frac{d}{2}$"
    ],
    [
      "$\\frac{d}{4}$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Distance of closest approach $d \\propto 1/K \\propto 1/v^2$.",
    "If velocity is doubled ($2v$), $d$ becomes $1/(2)^2 = 1/4$ of the original.",
    "New distance is $d/4$."
