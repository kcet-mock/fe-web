  "question": [
    "A ball of mass 0.2kg is thrown vertically down from a height of 10m. It collides with the floor and loses 50% of its energy and then rises back to the same height. The value of its initial velocity is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "196 ms⁻¹"
    ],
    [
      "$20~ms^{-1}$"
    ],
    [
      "Zero"
    ],
    [
      "$14~ms^{-1}$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Let initial velocity be $v$. Energy before impact $E_i = mgh + 0.5mv^2$.",
    "Energy after impact $E_f = 0.5 E_i = mgh$ (since it rises to same height h).",
    "$mgh + 0.5mv^2 = 2mgh \\Rightarrow 0.5v^2 = gh \\Rightarrow v = \\sqrt{2gh} = \\sqrt{200} \\approx 14$ m/s."
