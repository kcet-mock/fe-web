  "question": [
    "The figure shows variation of R, Xₗ and Xᴄ with frequency 'f' in a series LCR circuit. Then for what frequency point is the circuit capacitive?",

  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "B"
    ],
    [
      "C"
    ],
    [
      "A"
    ],
    [
      "D"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "A series LCR circuit is capacitive when Xᴄ > Xₗ.",
    "Looking at the graph, Xᴄ (the curve decreasing with frequency) is greater than Xₗ (the straight line increasing with frequency) at lower frequencies.",
    "Point A lies in the region where Xᴄ > Xₗ. Note: The options map Point A to choice (C)."
