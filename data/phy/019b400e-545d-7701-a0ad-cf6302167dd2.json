    "While determining the coefficient of viscosity of the given liquid, a spherical steel ball sinks by a distance h = 0.9m. The radius of the ball $r = 3 \\times 10^{-3}$ m. The time taken by the ball to sink in three trails are tabulated as follows.",
    "Trial 1: 2.75s",
    "Trial 2: 2.65s",
    "Trial 3: 2.70s",
    "The difference between the densities of the steel ball and the liquid is 7000 kg m$^{-3}$. If g = 10ms$^{-2}$, then the coefficient of viscosity of the given liquid at room temperature is"

    "Average time $t = (2.75+2.65+2.70)/3 = 2.7$ s.",
    "Terminal velocity $v = h/t = 0.9/2.7 = 1/3$ m/s.",
    "Stokes' Law formula: $\\eta = \\frac{2r^2 g (\\rho - \\sigma)}{9v}$.",
    "$\\eta = \\frac{2 \\times (3 \\times 10^{-3})^2 \\times 10 \\times 7000}{9 \\times (1/3)}$",
    "$\\eta = \\frac{2 \\times 9 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 70000}{3}$",
    "Calculation yields approx 0.14 Pa.s."
