  "choices": [
    [
      "Graph 1 (Linear)"
    ],
    [
      "Graph 2 (Hyperbolic)"

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "For an infinitely long straight wire, $B = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2\\pi r}$.",
    "Thus, $B \\propto \\frac{1}{r}$.",
    "This relationship is represented by a rectangular hyperbola (Graph 2)."
