  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "For a conducting sphere, the electric field inside (<katex>$r < R$</katex>) is zero.",
    "Outside the sphere (<katex>$r \\ge R$</katex>), the field behaves as a point charge: <katex>$E \\propto 1/r^2$</katex>.",
    "The graph should be zero up to R, then decay."
