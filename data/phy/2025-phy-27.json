  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Resistance <katex>$R = \\frac{\\rho l}{A} = \\frac{\\rho l}{\\pi r^2}$</katex>. [cite: 454]",
    "Since <katex>$r = D/2$</katex>, <katex>$R \\propto \\frac{1}{D^2}$</katex>. [cite: 454]",
    "The graph is a curve decreasing with D (hyperbolic type), corresponding to graph (3). [cite: 441, 450]"
