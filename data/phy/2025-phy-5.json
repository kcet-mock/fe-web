  "question": [
    "During an elastic collision between two bodies, which of the following statements are correct?",
    "I. The initial kinetic energy is equal to the final kinetic energy of the system.",
    "II. The linear momentum is conserved.",
    "III. The kinetic energy during the collision time <katex>$\\Delta t$</katex> is not conserved."
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "II and III only"
    ],
    [
      "I and III only"
    ],
    [
      "I, II and III"
    ],
    [
      "I and II only"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "In an elastic collision:",
    "I. Total kinetic energy before and after collision is the same.",
    "II. Linear momentum is always conserved in all collisions.",
    "III. During the brief interaction/deformation phase, some kinetic energy is temporarily stored as potential energy of deformation, so KE is not conserved *during* the collision instant.",
    "Therefore, all statements are correct."
