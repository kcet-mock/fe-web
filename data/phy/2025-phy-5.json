  "question": [
    "During an elastic collision between two bodies, which of the following statements are correct?",
    "I. The initial kinetic energy is equal to the final kinetic energy of the system.",
    "II. The linear momentum is conserved.",
    "III. The kinetic energy during <katex>$\\Delta t$</katex> (the collision time) is not conserved."
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "II and III only"
    ],
    [
      "I and III only"
    ],
    [
      "I, II and III"
    ],
    [
      "I and II only"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "I. Correct: In elastic collision, total initial KE equals total final KE.",
    "II. Correct: Linear momentum is always conserved in collisions (no external forces).",
    "III. Correct: During the brief collision time, some KE is stored as elastic potential energy, so instantaneous KE is not conserved.",
    "Therefore, all statements are correct."
