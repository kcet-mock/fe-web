  "question": [
    "During an elastic collision between two bodies, which of the following statements are correct?",
    "I. The initial kinetic energy is equal to the final kinetic energy of the system.",
    "II. The linear momentum is conserved.",
    "III. The kinetic energy during <katex>$\\Delta t$</katex> (the collision time) is not conserved."
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "II and III only"
    ],
    [
      "I and III only"
    ],
    [
      "I, II and III"
    ],
    [
      "I and II only"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "I. In an elastic collision, the total kinetic energy before collision equals the total kinetic energy after collision (Final total kinetic energy equals initial). [cite: 65, 75]",
    "II. Linear momentum is always conserved. [cite: 66, 76]",
    "III. During the brief interaction time <katex>$\\Delta t$</katex>, some kinetic energy is partly converted to potential energy of deformation. Thus, kinetic energy is not conserved *during* the collision process itself. [cite: 67, 77]",
    "All statements are correct. [cite: 78]"
