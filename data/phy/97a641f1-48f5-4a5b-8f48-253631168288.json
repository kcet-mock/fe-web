  "choices": [
    [
      "Deflects towards X' (Opposite)"
    ],
    [
      "Does not deflect"
    ],
    [
      "Oscillates"
    ],
    [
      "Deflects towards X"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "According to Lenz's law, the induced current opposes the change.",
    "Pushing causes deflection X. Pulling is the opposite change, so it causes deflection in the opposite direction (X')."
