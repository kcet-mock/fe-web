    [
      "<katex>$2\\mu F$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$5\\mu F$</katex>"

    [
      "<katex>$1\\mu F$</katex>"
    ]

  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": [
    "This is a balanced Wheatstone bridge of capacitors. The central capacitor is effectively open. The circuit becomes two series pairs in parallel. <katex>$(1 \\text{ series } 1) = 0.5$</katex>. <katex>$0.5 + 0.5 = 1 \\mu F$</katex>."
