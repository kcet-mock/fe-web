  "question": [
    "A block of certain mass is placed on a rough inclined plane. The angle between the plane and the horizontal is 30°. The coefficients of static and kinetic frictions between the block and the inclined plane are 0.6 and 0.5 respectively. Then the magnitude of the acceleration of the block is [Take g = 10 ms⁻²]"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "2 ms⁻²"
    ],
    [
      "zero"
    ],
    [
      "0.196 ms⁻²"
    ],
    [
      "0.67 ms⁻²"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Downward component g sin(30) = 0.5g.",
    "Max static friction μ_s g cos(30) = 0.6 × g × 0.866 ≈ 0.52g.",
    "Since pulling force (0.5g) < Max Friction (0.52g), the block does not move. Acceleration is zero."
