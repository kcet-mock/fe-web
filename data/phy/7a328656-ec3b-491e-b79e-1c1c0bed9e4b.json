  "question": [
    "The figure shows variation of R, <katex>$X_{L}$</katex> and <katex>$X_{C}$</katex> with frequency 'f' in a series LCR circuit. Then for what frequency point is the circuit capacitive?",

      "C (Note: Source answer is C, which corresponds to point A in options order or point C in graph)"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "The circuit is capacitive when capacitive reactance <katex>$X_C$</katex> is greater than inductive reactance <katex>$X_L$</katex>.",
    "Looking at the graph, <katex>$X_C$</katex> (the decaying curve) is greater than <katex>$X_L$</katex> (the linear rising line) at frequencies lower than the intersection point (resonance).",
    "Point A is in the region where <katex>$X_C > X_L$</katex>.",
    "Note: The correct option labeled in the source is (C), which refers to point 'A' in the diagram based on standard behavior (<katex>$f < f_r$</katex>)."
