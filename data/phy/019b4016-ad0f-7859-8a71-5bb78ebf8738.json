  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Torque $\\tau = TR = I\\alpha$. $I = \\frac{1}{2}MR^2 = R^2$. $\\alpha = a/R$.",
    "$TR = R^2(a/R) \\Rightarrow T=a$.",
    "Equation for block: $mg - T = ma \\Rightarrow 10 - a = 1a \\Rightarrow a=5 m/s^2$.",
    "$v = \\sqrt{2ah} = \\sqrt{2 \\times 5 \\times 1.6} = \\sqrt{16} = 4$ m/s."
