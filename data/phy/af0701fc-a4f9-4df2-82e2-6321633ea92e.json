  "question": [
    "Among the given pair of vectors, the resultant of two vectors can never be 3 units. The vectors are"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "1 unit and 2 units"
    ],
    [
      "2 units and 5 units"
    ],
    [
      "3 units and 6 units"
    ],
    [
      "4 units and 8 units"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "The resultant <katex>$R$</katex> of two vectors <katex>$A$</katex> and <katex>$B$</katex> lies in <katex>$|A-B| \\le R \\le |A+B|$</katex>.",
    "For 4 and 8: Range is <katex>$[4, 12]$</katex>. 3 is outside this range.",
    "Therefore, resultant cannot be 3."
