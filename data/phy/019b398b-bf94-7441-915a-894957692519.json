  "question": [
    "Magnetic susceptibility of Mg at 300 K is 1.2 × 10⁻⁵. What is its susceptibility at 200 K ?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "18 × 10⁻⁵"
    ],
    [
      "180 × 10⁻⁵"
    ],
    [
      "1.8 × 10⁻⁵"
    ],
    [
      "0.18 × 10⁻⁵"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "For paramagnetic materials, susceptibility χ ∝ 1/T (Curie's Law).",
    "χ₂ / χ₁ = T₁ / T₂ = 300 / 200 = 1.5.",
    "χ₂ = 1.5 × 1.2 × 10⁻⁵ = 1.8 × 10⁻⁵."
