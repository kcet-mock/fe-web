  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Resonance frequency is given by <katex>$f_0 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sqrt{LC}}$</katex>.",
    "This implies <katex>$f_0 \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{C}}$</katex>.",
    "As C increases, <katex>$f_0$</katex> decreases non-linearly.",
    "Graph C correctly represents this inverse relationship."
