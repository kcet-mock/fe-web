  "question": [
    "A metallic rod of length 1 m held along east-west direction is allowed to fall down freely. Given horizontal component of earth's magnetic field $B_{H}=3\\times10^{-5}T$. The emf induced in the rod at an instant $t=2s$ after it is released is (Take $g=10ms^{-2})$"

  "choices": [
    [
      "$3\\times10^{-4}V$"

  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Velocity $v = gt = 10 \\times 2 = 20 m/s$.",
    "Induced emf $e = B_H L v = 3\\times10^{-5} \\times 1 \\times 20 = 60 \\times 10^{-5} = 6 \\times 10^{-4} V$."
