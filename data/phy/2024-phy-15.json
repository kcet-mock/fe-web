  "question": [
    "The photoelectric work function for photo metal is 2.4 eV. Among the four wavelengths, the wavelength of light for which photo-emission does not take place is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "200 nm"
    ],
    [
      "300 nm"
    ],
    [
      "700 nm"
    ],
    [
      "400 nm"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Threshold wavelength <katex>$\\lambda_0 = \\frac{1240}{\\phi(eV)} \\approx \\frac{1240}{2.4} \\approx 517$</katex> nm.",
    "Photoemission occurs only if incident <katex>$\\lambda < \\lambda_0$</katex>.",
    "700 nm is greater than 517 nm, so emission does not take place."
