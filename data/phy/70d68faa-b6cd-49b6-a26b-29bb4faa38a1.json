    "The graph between variation of resistance of a metal wire as a function of its diameter keeping other parameters like length and temperature constant is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Graph 1"
    ],
    [
      "Graph 2"

      "Graph 3 (Rectangular hyperbola type)"
    ],
    [

  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Resistance <katex>$R = \\frac{\\rho L}{A} = \\frac{\\rho L}{\\pi (D/2)^2} = \\frac{4\\rho L}{\\pi D^2}$</katex>.",
    "So <katex>$R \\propto \\frac{1}{D^2}$</katex>.",
    "The graph of <katex>$R$</katex> vs <katex>$D$</katex> will be a curve decreasing rapidly (inverse square)."
