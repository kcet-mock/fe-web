  "question": [
    "Which of the following expression can be deduced on the basis of dimensional analysis?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "<katex>$x = A \\cos \\omega t$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$N = N_0 e^{-\\lambda t}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$F = 6\\pi \\eta r v$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$s = ut + \\frac{1}{2}at^2$</katex>"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Dimensional analysis cannot determine dimensionless constants (like <katex>$1/2, 6\\pi$</katex>) or trigonometric/exponential functions.",
    "However, the question asks what *can* be deduced. Usually, standard power laws can be deduced up to a constant.",
    "Wait, answer key says 3. Stokes law is often derived dimensionally as <katex>$F \\propto \\eta^a r^b v^c$</katex>."
