  "question": [
    "Consider the nuclear fission reaction ${}_{0}^{1}n+_{92}^{235}U\\rightarrow_{56}^{144}Ba+_{36}^{89}Kr+3_{0}^{1}n$. Assuming all the kinetic energy is carried away by the fast neutrons only and total binding energies of ${}_{92}^{235}U$ ${}_{56}^{144}Ba$ and ${}_{36}^{89}Kr$ to be 1800 MeV, 1200 MeV and 780 MeV respectively, the average kinetic energy carried by each fast neutron is (in MeV)"

  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Energy released $Q = BE_{products} - BE_{reactants} = (1200 + 780) - 1800 = 180$ MeV.",
    "This energy is shared by 3 neutrons.",
    "Energy per neutron = $180 / 3 = 60$ MeV."
