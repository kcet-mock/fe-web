  "question": [
    "A galaxy is moving away from the Earth so that a spectral line at 600 nm is observed at 601 nm. Then the speed of the galaxy with respect to the Earth is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "500 km s⁻¹"
    ],
    [
      "50 km s⁻¹"
    ],
    [
      "200 km s⁻¹"
    ],
    [
      "20 km s⁻¹"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Doppler shift Δλ/λ = v/c.",
    "Δλ = 601 - 600 = 1 nm.",
    "v = c(Δλ/λ) = (3 × 10⁸) × (1/600) = 0.5 × 10⁶ m/s = 500 × 10³ m/s = 500 km/s."
