    "A cubical Gaussian surface has side of length a = 10 cm. Electric field lines are parallel to x-axis as shown. The magnitudes of electric fields through surfaces ABCD and EFGH are 6kNC and 9kNC respectively. Then the total charge enclosed by the cube is [Take $\\epsilon_0 = 9 \\times 10^{-12}$ Fm]",

    "Net Flux $\\phi = (E_2 - E_1)A = (9-6) \\times 10^3 \\times (0.1)^2 = 30$.",
    "Charge $q = \\phi \\epsilon_0 = 30 \\times 9 \\times 10^{-12} = 270 \\times 10^{-12} C = 0.27 nC$."
