    "Pressure of ideal gas at constant volume is proportional to"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Total energy of the gas"
    ],
    [
      "Average kinetic energy of the molecules"
    ],
    [
      "Force between the molecules"
    ],
    [
      "Average potential energy of the molecules"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Pressure $P = \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{E}{V}$. At constant volume, $P \\propto E$ (Total internal kinetic energy)."
