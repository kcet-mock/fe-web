    "A ceiling fan is rotating around a fixed axle as shown. The direction of angular velocity along",
    "images/q30_diagram.png"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "<katex>$+\\hat{j}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$-\\hat{j}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$+\\hat{k}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$-\\hat{k}$</katex>"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Using the right-hand rule for the direction of rotation shown (clockwise looking from top, or counter-clockwise looking from bottom - diagram shows arrow curling around vertical axis). Assuming standard coordinate system shown (Z up, Y right, X out?).",
    "The diagram shows rotation around the vertical axis. If the curl is clockwise when viewed from above, the vector points downwards.",
    "The diagram shows the Z axis vertical. The rotation arrow suggests direction. Based on standard conventions and the answer key D (<katex>$-\\hat{k}$</katex>), the angular velocity vector points in the negative z-direction."
