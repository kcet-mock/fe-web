  "question": [
    "A thick metal wire of density p and length 'L' is hung from a rigid support. The increase in length of the wire due to its own weight is (Y = Young's modulus of the material of the wire)"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "$\\frac{\\rho~g~L}{Y}$"
    ],
    [
      "$\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\rho gL^{2}}{Y}$"
    ],
    [
      "$\\frac{\\rho~g~L^{2}}{Y}$"
    ],
    [
      "$\\frac{1}{4Y}\\rho~g~L^{2}$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "The elongation due to self-weight is equivalent to a load of half the weight applied at the end.",
    "$\\Delta L = \\frac{(Mg/2)L}{AY} = \\frac{(\\rho AL g)L}{2AY} = \\frac{\\rho g L^2}{2Y}$."
