  "question": [
    "If the angle of minimum deviation is equal to angle of a prism for an equilateral prism, then the speed of light inside the prism is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "3 × 10⁸ ms⁻¹"
    ],
    [
      "2√3 × 10⁸ ms⁻¹"
    ],
    [
      "√3 × 10⁸ ms⁻¹"
    ],
    [
      "(√3/2) × 10⁸ ms⁻¹"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "For an equilateral prism, A = 60°. Given minimum deviation δ_m = A = 60°.",
    "Refractive index μ = sin((A+δ_m)/2) / sin(A/2) = sin(60°) / sin(30°) = (√3/2) / (1/2) = √3.",
    "Speed of light v = c / μ = (3 × 10⁸) / √3 = √3 × 10⁸ ms⁻¹."
