  "question": [
    "Which of the following statements is not true?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Work done to move a charge on an equipotential surface is not zero"
    ],
    [
      "Equipotential surfaces are the surfaces where the potential is constant"
    ],
    [
      "Equipotential surfaces for a uniform electric field are parallel and equidistant from each other"
    ],
    [
      "Electric field is always perpendicular to an equipotential surfaces"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "An equipotential surface has the same potential at every point. The potential difference <katex>$\\Delta V = 0$</katex>.",
    "Work done <katex>$W = q\\Delta V = 0$</katex>.",
    "Statement 1 says work done is *not* zero, which is incorrect (not true)."
