  "question": [
    "Which of the following statements is not true?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Work done to move a charge on an equipotential surface is not zero"
    ],
    [
      "Equipotential surfaces are the surfaces where the potential is constant"
    ],
    [
      "Equipotential surfaces for a uniform electric field are parallel and equidistant from each other"
    ],
    [
      "Electric field is always perpendicular to an equipotential surfaces"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Equipotential surface is having same potential at every point so work done in moving a charge from one point to other is 0. [cite: 362]",
    "Thus, statement (1) claiming it is 'not zero' is incorrect."
