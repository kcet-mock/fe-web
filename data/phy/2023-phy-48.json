  "choices": [
    [
      "<katex>$1.6\\times10^{-19}C$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "Positive charge"
    ],
    [
      "Negative charge"
    ],
    [
      "Zero"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Since the sphere is isolated (insulated stand) and not touched or grounded, bringing a charge near it only induces polarization (separation of charge). The net charge remains zero."
