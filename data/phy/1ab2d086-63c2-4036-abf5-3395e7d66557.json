    "If AB is incident plane wave front then refracted wave front in <katex>$(n_2 > n_1)$</katex>",

  "choices": [
    [
      "Wavefront bending towards base/normal"
    ],
    [
      "Wavefront bending away"
    ],
    [
      "No bending"
    ],
    [
      "Curved wavefront"
    ]

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "When passing from rarer (<katex>$n_1$</katex>) to denser (<katex>$n_2$</katex>) medium through a prism/interface, the light slows down.",
    "The part of wavefront entering first slows down first, causing the wavefront to tilt.",
    "Based on the options and standard prism refraction, diagram 1 is correct."
