    "A cubical Gaussian surface has side of length <katex>$a=10$</katex> cm. Electric field lines are parallel to x-axis as shown. The magnitudes of electric fields through surfaces ABCD and EFGH are <katex>$6kNC^{-1}$</katex> and <katex>$9kNC^{-1}$</katex> respectively. Then the total charge enclosed by the cube is [Take <katex>$\\epsilon_{0}=9\\times10^{-12}Fm^{-1}$</katex>]",
