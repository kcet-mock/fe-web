  "question": [
    "A square loop of side length 'a' is moving away from an infinitely long current carrying conductor at a constant speed 'v' as shown. Let 'x' be the instantaneous distance between the long conductor and side AB. The mutual inductance (M) of the square loop - long conductor pair changes with time (t) according to which of the following graphs?",

  "choices": [
    [
      "Graph showing M decreasing exponentially with t"
    ],
    [
      "Graph showing M increasing linearly with t"

    [
      "Graph showing M constant with t"

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Mutual inductance <katex>$M$</katex> depends on the flux linkage per unit current.",
    "The magnetic field <katex>$B$</katex> due to the long wire decreases as <katex>$1/x$</katex>.",
    "As the loop moves away, <katex>$x = vt$</katex>, so the flux <katex>$\\phi$</katex> and thus <katex>$M$</katex> decrease non-linearly (logarithmically/inversely) with distance/time.",
    "The graph A shows a non-linear decay, which is the correct representation."
