  "question": [
    "Under electrostatic condition of a charged conductor, which among the following statements is true?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "The electric field on the surface of a charged conductor is <katex>$\\frac{\\sigma}{2\\epsilon_{0}}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "The electric potential inside a charged conductor is always zero"
    ],
    [
      "Any excess charge resides on the surface of the conductor"
    ],
    [
      "The net electric field is tangential to the surface of the conductor"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "For a charged conductor in electrostatic equilibrium:",
    "Excess charge resides entirely on the surface.",
    "Field inside is zero, Potential is constant (not necessarily zero).",
    "Field on surface is normal to the surface (not tangential) and equal to <katex>$\\sigma/\\epsilon_0$</katex>."
