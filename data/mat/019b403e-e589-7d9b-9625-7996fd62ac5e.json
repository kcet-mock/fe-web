    "The distance 's' in meters travelled by a particle in 't' seconds is given by $s=\\frac{2t^{3}}{3}-18t+\\frac{5}{3}.$ The acceleration when the particle comes to rest is"

  "choices": [
    [
      "$12m^{2}/sec$"
    ],
    [
      "$18m^{2}/sec$"

    [
      "$3m^{2}/sec$"

  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Velocity $v = \\frac{ds}{dt} = 2t^2 - 18$.",
    "Particle at rest: $v=0 \\implies 2t^2=18 \\implies t^2=9 \\implies t=3$.",
    "Acceleration $a = \\frac{dv}{dt} = 4t$.",
    "At $t=3$, $a = 4(3) = 12$."
