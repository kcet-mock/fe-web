  "explanation": [
    "Let point on curve be $P(x, x^2+2)$. Soldier at $A(3,2)$.",
    "Distance squared $D^2 = (x-3)^2 + (x^2+2-2)^2 = (x-3)^2 + x^4$.",
    "Minimize $f(x) = x^4 + x^2 - 6x + 9$. $f'(x) = 4x^3 + 2x - 6$.",
    "$x=1$ is a root ($4+2-6=0$).",
    "At $x=1$, point is $(1, 3)$.",
    "Distance $D = \\sqrt{(1-3)^2 + (3-2)^2} = \\sqrt{4+1} = \\sqrt{5}$."
