  "question": [
    "If the curve passes through the point (1, 1) and at any point (x, y) on the curve, the product of the slope of its tangent and x co-ordinate of the point is equal to the y co-ordinate of the point, then the curve also passes through the point"

  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Slope $m = dy/dx$. Condition: $x(dy/dx) = y$.",
    "$\\frac{dy}{y} = \\frac{dx}{x}$. Integrate: $\\ln y = \\ln x + \\ln C \\implies y = Cx$.",
    "Passes through (1,1) $\\implies 1 = C(1) \\implies C=1$.",
    "Curve is $y=x$. This passes through (2,2)."
