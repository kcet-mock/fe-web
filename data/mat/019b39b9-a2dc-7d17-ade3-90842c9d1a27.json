  "question": [
    "The family of curves whose x and y intercepts of a tangent at any point are respectively double the x and y coordinates of that point is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "xy = C"
    ],
    [
      "x^2 + y^2 = C"
    ],
    [
      "x^2 - y^2 = C"
    ],
    [
      "y/x = C"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "X-intercept $X = x - y/y' = 2x \\implies -y/y' = x \\implies y' = -y/x$.",
    "This leads to $\\frac{dy}{y} = -\\frac{dx}{x} \\implies \\ln y = -\\ln x + c \\implies xy = C$."
