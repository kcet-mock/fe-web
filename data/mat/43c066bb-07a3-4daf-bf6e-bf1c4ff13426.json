    "A and B are two sets having 3 and 6 elements respectively. Consider the following statements.",
    "Statement (I): Minimum number of elements in <katex>$A \\cup B$</katex> is 3",
    "Statement (II): Maximum number of elements in <katex>$A \\cap B$</katex> is 3",
    "Which of the following is correct?"

    [
      "Statement (I) is true, statement (II) is false"

  "explanation": [
    "Given <katex>$|A|=3, |B|=6$</katex>.",
    "Statement I: <katex>$|A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B|$</katex>. Min value occurs when overlap is max. Max overlap is 3. Min union = 3 + 6 - 3 = 6. Statement I says 3, which is false.",
    "Statement II: Max overlap <katex>$|A \\cap B|$</katex> is <katex>$\\min(|A|, |B|) = 3$</katex>. Statement II is true."
