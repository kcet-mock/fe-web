  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Statement: <katex>$p \\rightarrow q$</katex>. <katex>$p$</katex>: Lines do not intersect. <katex>$q$</katex>: Lines are parallel.",
    "Contrapositive: <katex>$\\sim q \\rightarrow \\sim p$</katex>.",
    "<katex>$\\sim q$</katex>: Lines are NOT parallel.",
    "<katex>$\\sim p$</katex>: Lines DO intersect.",
    "So: If two lines are not parallel then they intersect in the same plane."
