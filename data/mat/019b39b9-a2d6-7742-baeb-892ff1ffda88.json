  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Let the number of elements in the first set be $m$ and the second set be $n$.",
    "The number of subsets are $2^m$ and $2^n$ respectively.",
    "Given $2^m - 2^n = 56$.",
    "$2^n(2^{m-n} - 1) = 56$.",
    "Since $56 = 8 \\times 7 = 2^3 \\times (2^3 - 1)$, we can equate terms.",
    "$2^n = 2^3 \\implies n = 3$.",
    "$2^{m-n} - 1 = 7 \\implies 2^{m-3} = 8 = 2^3 \\implies m-3 = 3 \\implies m = 6$.",
    "Thus, m = 6 and n = 3."
