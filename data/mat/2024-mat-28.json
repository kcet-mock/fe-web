  "question": [
    "Which one of the following observations is correct for the features of logarithm function to any base <katex>$b>1$</katex>?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "The domain of the logarithm function is R, the set of real numbers."
    ],
    [
      "The range of the logarithm function is R, the set of all positive real numbers."
    ],
    [
      "The point (1, 0) is always on the graph of the logarithm function."
    ],
    [
      "The graph of the logarithm function is decreasing as we move from left to right."
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "For <katex>$\\log_b x$</katex>:",
    "Domain is <katex>$(0, \\infty)$</katex> (positive reals).",
    "Range is <katex>$R$</katex> (all reals).",
    "<katex>$\\log_b 1 = 0$</katex>, so (1,0) is always on the graph.",
    "For <katex>$b>1$</katex>, the function is increasing."
