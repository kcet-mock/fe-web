    "In the interval $(0,\\pi/2)$, area lying between the curves $y=tan~x$ and $y=cot~x$ and the X-axis is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "4 log 2 sq. units"
    ],
    [
      "log 2 sq. units"

    ],
    [
      "2 log 2 sq. units"
    ]

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Curves intersect at $\\pi/4$. Area is $\\int_0^{\\pi/4} \\tan x dx + \\int_{\\pi/4}^{\\pi/2} \\cot x dx$.",
    "By symmetry, both integrals are equal.",
    "$2 \\int_0^{\\pi/4} \\tan x dx = 2 [\\ln |\\sec x|]_0^{\\pi/4} = 2 (\\ln \\sqrt{2} - \\ln 1) = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\ln 2 = \\ln 2$."
