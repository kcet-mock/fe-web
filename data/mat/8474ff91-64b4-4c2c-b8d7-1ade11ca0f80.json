  "question": [
    "Consider the following statements:",
    "Statement(I): The set of all solutions of the linear inequalities <katex>$3x+8<17$</katex> and <katex>$2x+8 \\ge 12$</katex> are <katex>$x<3$</katex> and <katex>$x \\ge 2$</katex> respectively.",
    "Statement(II): The common set of solutions of linear inequalities <katex>$3x+8<17$</katex> and <katex>$2x+8 \\ge 12$</katex> is (2, 3)",
    "Which of the following is true?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Statement (I) is true but statement (II) is false"
    ],
    [
      "Statement (I) is false but statement (II) is true"
    ],
    [
      "Both the statements are true"
    ],
    [
      "Both the statements are false"
    ]

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Inequality 1: <katex>$3x < 9 \\Rightarrow x < 3$</katex>.",
    "Inequality 2: <katex>$2x \\ge 4 \\Rightarrow x \\ge 2$</katex>. Statement I is true.",
    "Common solution is <katex>$2 \\le x < 3$</katex>, written as [2, 3). The statement says (2, 3), which excludes 2. Statement II is false."
