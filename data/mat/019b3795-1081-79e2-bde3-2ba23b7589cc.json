  "question": [
    "Let $A=\\{a,b,c\\}$, then the number of equivalence relations on A containing (b, c) is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "1"
    ],
    [
      "3"
    ],
    [
      "2"
    ],
    [

    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Relation must be reflexive: contains (a,a), (b,b), (c,c).",
    "Must contain (b,c). By symmetry, must contain (c,b).",
    "Case 1: $R_1 = \\{(a,a), (b,b), (c,c), (b,c), (c,b)\\}$. This is transitive. (1 relation)",
    "Case 2: Add (a,b). Must add (b,a). By transitivity with (b,c), must add (a,c) and (c,a).",
    "$R_2 = A \\times A$ (Universal relation).",
    "Any intermediate relation fails transitivity. So there are exactly 2 relations."
