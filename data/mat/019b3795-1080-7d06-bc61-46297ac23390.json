  "question": [
    "A and B are two sets having 3 and 6 elements respectively.",
    "Consider the following statements:",
    "Statement (I): Minimum number of elements in $A \\cup B$ is 3",
    "Statement (II): Maximum number of elements in $A \\cap B$ is 3",
    "Which of the following is correct?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Statement (I) is true, statement (II) is false"
    ],
    [
      "Statement (I) is false, statement (II) is true"
    ],
    [
      "Both statements (I) and (II) are true"
    ],
    [
      "Both statements (I) and (II) are false"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Given $|A|=3$ and $|B|=6$.",
    "Statement (I): $|A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B|$. The minimum value occurs when intersection is maximum. Max $|A \\cap B| = \\min(|A|, |B|) = 3$. So min $|A \\cup B| = 3 + 6 - 3 = 6$. Statement (I) claims it is 3, which is false.",
    "Statement (II): The maximum number of elements in the intersection of two sets is the number of elements in the smaller set. Max $|A \\cap B| = 3$. Statement (II) is true."
