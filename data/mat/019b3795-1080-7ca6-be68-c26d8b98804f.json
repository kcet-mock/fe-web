  "question": [
    "Domain of the function f, given by $f(x)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(x-2)(x-5)}}$ is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "$(-\\infty,2]\\cup[5,\\infty)$"
    ],
    [
      "$(-\\infty,2)\\cup(5,\\infty)$"
    ],
    [
      "$(-\\infty,3)\\cup[5,\\infty)$"
    ],
    [
      "$(-\\infty,3]\\cup(5,\\infty)$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "For the function to be defined, the expression inside the square root in the denominator must be strictly positive.",
    "$(x-2)(x-5) > 0$.",
    "The critical points are 2 and 5.",
    "For $x < 2$, both factors are negative, product is positive.",
    "For $2 < x < 5$, one is positive, one is negative, product is negative.",
    "For $x > 5$, both are positive, product is positive.",
    "Since it is in the denominator, it cannot be zero, so we use open intervals.",
    "Domain is $(-\\infty, 2) \\cup (5, \\infty)$."
