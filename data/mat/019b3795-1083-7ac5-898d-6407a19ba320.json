  "question": [
    "Which of the following statements is not correct?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "A row matrix has only one row"
    ],
    [
      "A diagonal matrix has all diagonal elements equal to zero"
    ],
    [
      "A symmetric matrix A is a square matrix satisfying $A^{\\prime}=A$"
    ],
    [
      "A skew symmetric matrix has all diagonal elements equal to zero"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Option 1: Definition of row matrix. Correct.",
    "Option 2: Definition of diagonal matrix is that all NON-diagonal elements are zero. Diagonal elements can be anything. Saying diagonal elements ARE zero is false.",
    "Option 3: Definition of symmetric. Correct.",
    "Option 4: Skew symmetric property requires $a_{ii} = -a_{ii} \\Rightarrow 2a_{ii}=0 \\Rightarrow a_{ii}=0$. Correct."
