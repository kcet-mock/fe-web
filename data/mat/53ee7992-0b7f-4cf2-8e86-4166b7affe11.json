  "question": [
    "Consider the following statements.",
    "Statement (I): If E and F are two independent events, then E' and F' are also independent.",
    "Statement (II): Two mutually exclusive events with non-zero probabilities of occurrence cannot be independent.",
    "Which of the following is correct?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Statement (I) is true and statement (II) is false"
    ],
    [
      "Statement (I) is false and statement (II) is true"
    ],
    [
      "Both the statements are true"
    ],
    [
      "Both the statements are false"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Statement I is a standard theorem of probability.",
    "Statement II is true because if mutually exclusive, <katex>$P(E \\cap F) = 0$</katex>. If independent, <katex>$P(E \\cap F) = P(E)P(F)$</katex>. If probs are non-zero, the product is non-zero, creating a contradiction."
