  "question": [
    "Corner points of the feasible region for an LPP are (0, 2), (3, 0), (6, 0), (6, 8) and (0, 5). Let z=4x+6y be the objective function. The minimum value of z occurs at"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Only (0, 2)"
    ],
    [
      "Only (3, 0)"
    ],
    [
      "The mid-point of the line segment joining the points (0, 2) and (3, 0)"
    ],
    [
      "Any point on the line segment joining the points (0, 2) and (3, 0)"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Z at (0,2) = 12.",
    "Z at (3,0) = 12.",
    "Since the minimum value (12) occurs at two corner points, it occurs at every point on the line segment joining them."
