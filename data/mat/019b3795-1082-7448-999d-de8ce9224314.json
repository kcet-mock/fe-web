  "question": [
    "Consider the following statements:",
    "Statement(I): The set of all solutions of the linear inequalities $3x+8<17$ and $2x+8\\ge12$ are $x<3$ and $x\\ge2$ respectively.",
    "Statement(II): The common set of solutions of linear inequalities $3x+8<17$ and $2x+8\\ge12$ is (2, 3)",
    "Which of the following is true?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Statement (I) is true but statement (II) is false"
    ],
    [
      "Statement (I) is false but statement (II) is true"
    ],
    [
      "Both the statements are true"
    ],
    [
      "Both the statements are false"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Solve $3x+8 < 17$: $3x < 9 \\Rightarrow x < 3$.",
    "Solve $2x+8 \\ge 12$: $2x \\ge 4 \\Rightarrow x \\ge 2$.",
    "Statement I is correct.",
    "Common solution is intersection of $x < 3$ and $x \\ge 2$. This is $[2, 3)$.",
    "Statement II says $(2, 3)$ which excludes 2. Thus Statement II is false."
