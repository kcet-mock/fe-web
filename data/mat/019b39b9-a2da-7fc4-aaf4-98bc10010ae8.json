    "The function $f(x)=|\\cos x|$ is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Everywhere continuous and differentiable"
    ],
    [
      "Everywhere continuous but not differentiable at odd multiples of π/2"

    [
      "Neither continuous nor differentiable at (2n+1)π/2"
    ],
    [
      "Not differentiable everywhere"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "The modulus function $|u|$ is continuous everywhere but not differentiable where $u=0$.",
    "Here $\\cos x = 0$ at $x = (2n+1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.",
    "Thus, it is continuous everywhere but not differentiable at odd multiples of $\\pi/2$."
