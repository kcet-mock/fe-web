    "Consider the following statements:",
    "Statement(I): The set of all solutions of the linear inequalities <katex>$3x+8<17$</katex> and <katex>$2x+8\\ge12$</katex> are <katex>$x<3$</katex> and <katex>$x\\ge2$</katex> respectively.",
    "Statement(II): The common set of solutions of linear inequalities <katex>$3x+8<17$</katex> and <katex>$2x+8\\ge12$</katex> is (2, 3)",
    "Which of the following is true?"

  "choices": [
    [
      "Statement (I) is true but statement (II) is false"
    ],
    [
      "Statement (I) is false but statement (II) is true"

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Solve <katex>$3x+8 < 17 \\Rightarrow 3x < 9 \\Rightarrow x < 3$</katex>.",
    "Solve <katex>$2x+8 \\ge 12 \\Rightarrow 2x \\ge 4 \\Rightarrow x \\ge 2$</katex>.",
    "So Statement (I) is correct.",
    "The common solution is the intersection of <katex>$x < 3$</katex> and <katex>$x \\ge 2$</katex>, which is <katex>$[2, 3)$</katex> or <katex>$\\{x: 2 \\le x < 3\\}$</katex>.",
    "Statement (II) claims the solution is <katex>$(2, 3)$</katex> (open interval) or a set <katex>$\\{2, 3\\}$</katex>. Mathematically, the correct interval is <katex>$[2, 3)$</katex>. The statement says \"(2, 3)\" which excludes 2, making it false. Or if it implies discrete integer solutions, it might be {2}. Given the options and typical precision, Statement II is considered false because it misses the boundary condition or is just the integers."
