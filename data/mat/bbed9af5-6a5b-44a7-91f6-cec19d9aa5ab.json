  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "The relations must contain reflexive pairs (a,a), (b,b), (c,c) and the pair (b,c).",
    "By symmetry, it must contain (c,b).",
    "Case 1: Smallest relation <katex>$R_1 = \\{(a,a), (b,b), (c,c), (b,c), (c,b)\\}$</katex>. This is an equivalence relation.",
    "Case 2: Adding (a,b) requires adding (b,a), (a,c), (c,a) for transitive/symmetric properties, resulting in the universal relation <katex>$A \\times A$</katex>.",
    "Thus, there are exactly 2 such relations."
