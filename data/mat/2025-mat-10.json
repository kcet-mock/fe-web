  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Smallest equivalence relation containing (b,c) must contain (c,b) and diagonals: <katex>$R_1 = \\{(a,a), (b,b), (c,c), (b,c), (c,b)\\}$</katex>.",
    "Largest is <katex>$R_2 = A \\times A$</katex>.",
    "Any other relation must involve 'a'. If we add (a,b), we must add (b,a), (a,c), (c,a) due to transitivity with (b,c). This leads to <katex>$A \\times A$</katex>.",
    "So there are exactly 2 equivalence relations."
