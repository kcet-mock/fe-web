    "A bag contains <katex>$2n+1$</katex> coins. It is known that n of these coins have head on both sides whereas the other <katex>$n+1$</katex> coins are fair. One coin is selected at random and tossed. If the probability that toss results in heads is <katex>$\\frac{31}{42}$</katex> then the value of n is"

    "Total coins <katex>$N = 2n+1$</katex>.",
    "P(Head) = P(Biased) * 1 + P(Fair) * 0.5",
    "<katex>$= \\frac{n}{2n+1}(1) + \\frac{n+1}{2n+1}(\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{2n + n + 1}{2(2n+1)} = \\frac{3n+1}{4n+2}$</katex>.",
    "<katex>$\\frac{3n+1}{4n+2} = \\frac{31}{42}$</katex>.",
    "<katex>$42(3n+1) = 31(4n+2) \\implies 126n + 42 = 124n + 62 \\implies 2n = 20 \\implies n=10$</katex>."
