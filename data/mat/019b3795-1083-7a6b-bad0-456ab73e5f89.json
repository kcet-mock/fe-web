  "question": [
    "If A and B are two matrices such that AB is an identity matrix and the order of matrix B is $3\\times4$, then the order of matrix A is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "$3\\times4$"
    ],
    [
      "$3\\times3$"
    ],
    [
      "$4\\times3$"
    ],
    [
      "$4\\times4$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Let order of A be $m \\times n$. Order of B is $3 \\times 4$.",
    "For AB to exist, $n = 3$.",
    "The result AB has order $m \\times 4$.",
    "Since AB = Identity matrix, it must be square. So $m = 4$.",
    "Order of A is $4 \\times 3$."
