    "The distance between the foci of a hyperbola is 16 and its eccentricity is $\\sqrt{2}.$ Its equation is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "$2x^{2}-3y^{2}=7$"
    ],
    [
      "$y^{2}-x^{2}=32$"
    ],
    [
      "$x^{2}-y^{2}=32$"
    ],
    [
      "$\\frac{x^{2}}{4}-\\frac{y^{2}}{9}=1$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Distance between foci $2ae = 16 \\implies ae = 8$.",
    "Given $e = \\sqrt{2}$, so $a\\sqrt{2} = 8 \\implies a = 4\\sqrt{2} \\implies a^2 = 32$.",
    "$b^2 = a^2(e^2-1) = 32(2-1) = 32$.",
    "Equation: $x^2/32 - y^2/32 = 1 \\implies x^2 - y^2 = 32$."
