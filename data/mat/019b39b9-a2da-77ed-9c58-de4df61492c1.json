  "question": [
    "Which one of the following observations is correct for the features of logarithm function to any base b>1?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "The domain of the logarithm function is R, the set of real numbers."
    ],
    [
      "The range of the logarithm function is R, the set of all positive real numbers."
    ],
    [
      "The point (1, 0) is always on the graph of the logarithm function."
    ],
    [
      "The graph of the logarithm function is decreasing as we move from left to right."
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "For $\\log_b x$ where $b > 1$: Domain is $(0, \\infty)$, Range is $\\mathbb{R}$, and it is an increasing function.",
    "Since $\\log_b 1 = 0$, the graph always passes through (1, 0)."
