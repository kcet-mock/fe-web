    "P(A) = 2/5, P(B) = 1 - 2/5 = 3/5.",
    "Let F be event she meets friend.",
    "P(F|A) = 1/3.",
    "P(F|B) = 2/7.",
    "We need P(B|F) using Bayes Theorem.",
    "$P(B|F) = \\frac{P(F|B)P(B)}{P(F|A)P(A) + P(F|B)P(B)}$",
    "Numerator = $(2/7) * (3/5) = 6/35$.",
    "Denominator = $(1/3)*(2/5) + (2/7)*(3/5) = 2/15 + 6/35 = (14 + 18) / 105 = 32/105$.",
    "$P(B|F) = (6/35) / (32/105) = (6/35) * (105/32) = 6 * 3 / 32 = 18/32 = 9/16$."
