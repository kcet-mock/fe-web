  "question": [
    "Consider the following statements.",
    "Statement (I): If E and F are two independent events, then E' and F' are also independent.",
    "Statement (II): Two mutually exclusive events with non-zero probabilities of occurrence cannot be independent.",
    "Which of the following is correct?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Statement (I) is true and statement (II) is false"
    ],
    [
      "Statement (I) is false and statement (II) is true"
    ],
    [
      "Both the statements are true"
    ],
    [
      "Both the statements are false"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Statement I: It is a standard property that if E, F are independent, then their complements E', F' are also independent.",
    "Statement II: If A and B are mutually exclusive, <katex>$P(A \\cap B) = 0$</katex>. If they are independent, <katex>$P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B)$</katex>. Since <katex>$P(A) \\neq 0$</katex> and <katex>$P(B) \\neq 0$</katex>, <katex>$P(A)P(B) \\neq 0$</katex>. Thus they cannot be both mutually exclusive and independent. Statement II is true."
