  "question": [
    "Consider the following statements:",
    "Statement (I): In a LPP, the objective function is always linear.",
    "Statement (II): In a LPP, the linear inequalities on variables are called constraints.",
    "Which of the following is correct?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Statement (I) is true, Statement (II) is true"
    ],
    [
      "Statement (I) is true, Statement (II) is false"
    ],
    [
      "Both Statements (I) and (II) are false"
    ],
    [
      "Statement (I) is false, Statement (II) is true"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "In Linear Programming Problems (LPP), the objective function must be a linear function of the variables (e.g., <katex>$Z = ax + by$</katex>).",
    "The restrictions on the variables are expressed as linear inequalities, known as constraints.",
    "Both statements are definitions of LPP components and are true."
