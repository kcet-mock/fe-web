  "question": [
    "If 'a' and 'b' are the order and degree respectively of the differentiable equation $(\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2})^2 + (\\frac{dy}{dx})^3 + x^4 = 0$, then $a - b =$"

  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Order (a) is highest derivative: 2.",
    "Degree (b) is power of highest derivative: 2.",
    "$a - b = 2 - 2 = 0$."
