  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "3 women choose from 6 chairs (1-6). Order matters (who sits where). Ways = <katex>${}^6P_3$</katex>.",
    "Remaining chairs = <katex>$10 - 3 = 7$</katex>. Men choose from remaining. The question says 'men choose the chairs from the remaining'.",
    "Wait, 'remaining' usually means the chairs not taken. Total 10 chairs. Women take 3. 7 left.",
    "But men usually sit in the remaining of the *whole set* or remaining of the *specific set*? 'chairs from the remaining'. Likely the remaining 7 chairs.",
    "Wait, source option D is <katex>${}^6P_3 \\times {}^4P_2$</katex>. This implies men choose from 4 chairs.",
    "Ah, 'women choose chairs marked 1 to 6'. 3 chairs taken. 3 chairs left in (1-6) + 4 chairs in (7-10). Total 7.",
    "Maybe the question implies men choose from the *remaining of the first set*? No, unlikely.",
    "Maybe 'remaining' implies the chairs 7, 8, 9, 10? 'First women choose... 1 to 6... then men choose... from the remaining'. This could mean 'the remaining chairs (7-10)' if '1 to 6' was a reserved section? Or 'remaining available chairs'.",
    "If men choose from 7 remaining chairs: <katex>${}^7P_2$</katex>.",
    "If men choose from chairs 7-10 (4 chairs): <katex>${}^4P_2$</katex>.",
    "Given the option D: <katex>${}^6P_3 \\times {}^4P_2$</katex>, it strongly suggests men choose from a set of 4. This implies chairs 7,8,9,10 are the 'remaining' set available for men, or the only ones considered.",
    "Interpretation: Women pick from 1-6. Men pick from 7-10. This matches the math <katex>${}^6P_3 \\times {}^4P_2$</katex>."
