  "question": [
    "Let a, b, c, d and e be the observations with mean m and standard deviation S. The standard deviation of the observations a+k, b+k, c+k, d+k and e+k is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "kS"
    ],
    [
      "S+k"
    ],
    [
      "S/k"
    ],
    [
      "S"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Adding a constant to every observation affects the mean (increases by k) but does not affect the spread of the data.",
    "Therefore, the standard deviation remains unchanged."
