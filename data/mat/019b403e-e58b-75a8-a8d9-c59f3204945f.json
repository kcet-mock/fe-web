    "The shaded region in the figure (Triangle with vertices (-3,0), (7,0), B(3,4) with lower boundary on x-axis and upper bounded by lines through B) is given by the solution of which of the inequations?",

  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Line AB passes through (7,0) and (3,4). Slope -1. Eq: $x+y=7$. Region is below: $x+y\\le7$.",
    "Line CB passes through (-3,0) and (3,4). Slope $4/6 = 2/3$. Eq: $y-0 = 2/3(x+3) \\implies 3y = 2x+6 \\implies 2x-3y+6=0$. Region is below? Test (0,0) -> $6 \\ge 0$ (True). Wait, region is the triangle. For line $2x-3y+6=0$, the origin is inside. So $2x-3y+6 \\ge 0$.",
    "Matches C."
