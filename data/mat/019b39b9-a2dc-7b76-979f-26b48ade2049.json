    "The area of the region bounded by the line y=x and the curve y=x^3 is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "0.2 sq. units"
    ],
    [
      "0.3 sq. units"
    ],
    [
      "0.4 sq. units"
    ],
    [
      "0.5 sq. units"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Intersection: $x^3 = x \\implies x = 0, 1, -1$.",
    "Due to symmetry, area $= 2 \\int_0^1 (x - x^3) dx$.",
    "$= 2 [\\frac{x^2}{2} - \\frac{x^4}{4}]_0^1 = 2(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}) = 2(0.25) = 0.5$."
