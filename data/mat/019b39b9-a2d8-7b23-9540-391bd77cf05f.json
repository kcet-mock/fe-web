  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Using L'Hopital's Rule as it is a 0/0 form.",
    "Differentiate numerator: $-\\sqrt{2}\\sin x$.",
    "Differentiate denominator: $-\\csc^2 x$.",
    "Limit becomes $\\frac{-\\sqrt{2}\\sin(\\pi/4)}{-\\csc^2(\\pi/4)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}(1/\\sqrt{2})}{(\\sqrt{2})^2} = \\frac{1}{2}$."
