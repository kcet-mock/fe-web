    "The equation of parabola whose focus is (6, 0) and directrix is <katex>$x=-6$</katex> is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "<katex>$y^{2}=24x$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$y^{2}=-24x$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$x^{2}=24y$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$x^{2}=-24y$</katex>"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "The focus (6,0) lies on the x-axis, so the axis of symmetry is the x-axis.",
    "Distance from vertex to focus <katex>$a = 6$</katex> (since vertex is at origin, midpoint of (6,0) and x=-6).",
    "Equation is of the form <katex>$y^2 = 4ax$</katex>.",
    "<katex>$y^2 = 4(6)x = 24x$</katex>."
