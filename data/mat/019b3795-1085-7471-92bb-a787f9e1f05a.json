  "question": [
    "Match the following functions in Column I with properties in Column II for interval (-1, 1).",
    "Column I: (a) x|x|, (b) |x|, (c) x + [x], (d) |x-1| + |x+1|",
    "Column II: (i) continuous, (ii) differentiable, (iii) strictly increasing, (iv) not differentiable at least one point"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "a-i, b-ii, c-iv, d-iii"
    ],
    [
      "a-iv, b-iii, c-i, d-ii"
    ],
    [
      "a-ii, b-iv, c-iii, d-i"
    ],
    [
      "a-iii, b-ii, c-iv, d-i"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "(a) $x|x|$ is differentiable at 0. $2x$ for $x>0$, $-2x$ for $x<0$. Matches (ii) differentiable.",
    "(b) $|x|$ is not differentiable at 0. Matches (iv).",
    "(c) $x + [x]$ has a jump at $x=0$. Wait, in (-1,1), [x] is -1 for x<0 and 0 for x>=0. Discontinuous at 0. But option 3 maps c to iii (strictly increasing)? In (-1,0) $x-1$ (inc), in (0,1) $x$ (inc). Jump up. It is strictly increasing.",
    "(d) $|x-1| + |x+1|$ in (-1,1) is $(1-x) + (x+1) = 2$. Constant. Continuous and Differentiable. Matches (i) Continuous.",
    "Result: a-ii, b-iv, c-iii, d-i."
