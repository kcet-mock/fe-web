    "Meera visits only one of the two temples A and B in her locality. Probability that she visits temple A is 2/5. If she visits temple A, probability she meets her friend is 1/3, whereas it is 2/7 if she visits temple B. Meera met her friend at one of the two temples. The probability that she met her at temple B is"

    "Using Bayes' theorem:",
    "P(B) = 1 - P(A) = 3/5.",
    "P(Meet) = P(A)P(M|A) + P(B)P(M|B) = (2/5)(1/3) + (3/5)(2/7) = 2/15 + 6/35 = (14+18)/105 = 32/105.",
    "P(B|Meet) = (P(B)P(M|B)) / P(Meet) = (6/35) / (32/105) = (6/35) * (105/32) = 9/16."
