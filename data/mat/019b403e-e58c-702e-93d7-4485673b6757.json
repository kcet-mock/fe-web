      "1"
    ],
    [
      "$\\frac{4}{3}$"

    [
      "$\\frac{2}{3}$"
    ]

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Slope of given line is -3. Perpendicular slope $m = 1/3$.",
    "Eq: $y - 2 = (1/3)(x - 2) \\implies 3y - 6 = x - 2 \\implies x - 3y + 4 = 0$.",
    "Y-intercept (put x=0): $-3y + 4 = 0 \\implies y = 4/3$."
