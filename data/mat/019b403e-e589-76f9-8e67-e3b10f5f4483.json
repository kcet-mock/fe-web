  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Given $\\frac{dx}{dt} = 4 \\frac{dy}{dt}$.",
    "Diff equation: $\\frac{2x}{16}\\frac{dx}{dt} + \\frac{2y}{4}\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0$.",
    "$\\frac{x}{8}(4\\frac{dy}{dt}) + \\frac{y}{2}\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0$.",
    "$\\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{y}{2} = 0 \\implies y = -x$.",
    "Points where $x$ and $y$ have opposite signs are in Quadrants II and IV."
