    "Corner points of the feasible region for an LPP are (0, 2), (3, 0), (6, 0), (6, 8) and (0, 5).",
    "Let <katex>$z=4x+6y$</katex> be the objective function. The minimum value of z occurs at"

  "explanation": [
    "At (0,2): <katex>$z = 4(0)+6(2) = 12$</katex>.",
    "At (3,0): <katex>$z = 4(3)+6(0) = 12$</katex>.",
    "Since min value is the same at two corner points, it occurs at every point on the segment joining them."
