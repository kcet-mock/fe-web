    "A bag contains $2n+1$ coins. It is known that n of these coins have head on both sides whereas the other $n+1$ coins are fair. One coin is selected at random and tossed. If the probability that toss results in heads is $\\frac{31}{42}$ then the value of n is"

    "Total coins $2n+1$.",
    "P(Head) = P(H|Biased)P(Biased) + P(H|Fair)P(Fair).",
    "$31/42 = (1)(\\frac{n}{2n+1}) + (1/2)(\\frac{n+1}{2n+1})$.",
    "$31/42 = \\frac{2n + n + 1}{2(2n+1)} = \\frac{3n+1}{2(2n+1)}$.",
    "$31(2n+1) = 21(3n+1) \\implies 62n + 31 = 63n + 21 \\implies n = 10$."
