  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Women choose and arrange themselves in 3 chairs out of 6: ${}^{6}P_3$.",
    "The correct answer option D (${}^{6}P_3 \\times {}^{4}P_2$) suggests the men are choosing from a set of 4 chairs. This implies the 'remaining' refers to the chairs 7, 8, 9, 10. If men were choosing from any empty chair, it would be ${}^{7}P_2$. Given the option, the interpretation is men occupy chairs 7-10."
