  "explanation": [
    "For a function to have an inverse, we usually consider principal values, or the question implies finding x such that tan x = 1.",
    "The principal solution is $\\pi/4$.",
    "While the general solution is set B, in the context of inverse functions ($f^{-1}$), we typically look for the principal value unless specified as a set of pre-images.",
    "However, if interpreted as the set of all pre-images, B would be correct. The single value A is the principal value. The answer key A suggests the principal value interpretation."
