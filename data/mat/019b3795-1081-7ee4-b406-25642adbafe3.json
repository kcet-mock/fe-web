    "A random experiment has five outcomes $W_{1}, W_{2}, W_{3}, W_{4}$ and $W_{5}$. The probabilities of the occurrence of the outcomes are respectively $a, b, a, b$ and $\\frac{1}{12}$ such that $12a+12b-1=0$.",

  "explanation": [
    "Note: There appears to be a discrepancy in the original question text vs solution regarding specific values, but following the solution logic:",
    "Sum of probabilities = 1. So $P(W_1)+P(W_2)+P(W_3)+P(W_4)+P(W_5) = 1$.",
    "Based on solution logic: The question statement seems garbled in OCR but the solution works out $P(W_5) = 1/12$. The solution mentions $x = 2/3$.",
    "Looking closely at the solution steps: $1/6 + a + b + x + 1/12 = 1$. This implies the probabilities were likely $1/6, a, b, x, 1/12$.",
    "However, taking the question text: outcomes a, b, a, b, 1/12. Sum: $2a + 2b + 1/12 = 1$.",
    "$2(a+b) = 11/12 \\Rightarrow a+b = 11/24$.",
    "Given $12(a+b) = 12(11/24) = 5.5 \\neq 1$. The constraint $12a+12b-1=0$ implies $a+b = 1/12$.",
    "If $a+b=1/12$, sum is $2(1/12) + 1/12 = 3/12 \\neq 1$.",
    "Let's follow the solution specifically: It finds $x=2/3$. It seems the question asks for a specific outcome probability which turned out to be $2/3$. Option 1 matches this."
