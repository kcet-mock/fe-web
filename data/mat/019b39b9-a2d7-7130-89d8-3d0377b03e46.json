  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Slope of $x+y=3$ is $m_1 = -1$.",
    "Slope of line joining (1,1) and (-3,4) is $m_2 = \\frac{4-1}{-3-1} = \\frac{3}{-4} = -\\frac{3}{4}$.",
    "Angle $\\theta$ is given by $\\tan \\theta = |\\frac{m_2 - m_1}{1 + m_1 m_2}|$.",
    "$\\tan \\theta = |\\frac{-3/4 - (-1)}{1 + (-1)(-3/4)}| = |\\frac{1/4}{7/4}| = \\frac{1}{7}$.",
    "$\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(1/7)$."
