    "The function <katex>$f(x)=|cos~x|$</katex> is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Everywhere continuous and differentiable"
    ],
    [
      "Everywhere continuous but not differentiable at odd multiples of <katex>$\\frac{\\pi}{2}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "Neither continuous nor differentiable at <katex>$(2n+1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}$</katex>"

    [
      "Not differentiable everywhere"

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "The modulus function <katex>$|t|$</katex> is continuous everywhere but not differentiable at <katex>$t=0$</katex>.",
    "Here <katex>$t = \\cos x$</katex>. So it is not differentiable where <katex>$\\cos x = 0$</katex>.",
    "<katex>$\\cos x = 0$</katex> at <katex>$x = (2n+1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}$</katex>.",
    "It is continuous everywhere."
