  "question": [
    "If the curve passes through the point (1, 1) and at any point (x, y) on the curve, the product of the slope of its tangent and x co-ordinate of the point is equal to the y co-ordinate of the point, then the curve also passes through the point"

  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "<katex>$x \\frac{dy}{dx} = y \\implies \\frac{dy}{y} = \\frac{dx}{x} \\implies \\ln y = \\ln x + c \\implies y = kx$</katex>.",
    "Passes through (1,1) <katex>$\\implies k=1 \\implies y=x$</katex>.",
    "Curve is <katex>$y=x$</katex>. Passes through (2,2)."
