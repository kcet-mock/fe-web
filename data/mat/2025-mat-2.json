    "A and B are two sets having 3 and 6 elements respectively. Consider the following statements.",
    "Statement (I): Minimum number of elements in <katex>$A \\cup B$</katex> is 3",
    "Statement (II): Maximum number of elements in <katex>$A \\cap B$</katex> is 3",
    "Which of the following is correct?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Statement (I) is true, statement (II) is false"
    ],
    [
      "Statement (I) is false, statement (II) is true"
    ],
    [
      "Both statements (I) and (II) are true"
    ],
    [
      "Both statements (I) and (II) are false"

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Given <katex>$|A|=3$</katex> and <katex>$|B|=6$</katex>.",
    "We know <katex>$|A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B|$</katex>.",
    "To find the minimum elements in <katex>$A \\cup B$</katex>, we maximize <katex>$|A \\cap B|$</katex>. The maximum intersection is <katex>$\\min(|A|, |B|) = 3$</katex>.",
    "<katex>$\\min|A \\cup B| = 3 + 6 - 3 = 6$</katex>. Thus, Statement (I) is false.",
    "The maximum number of elements in <katex>$A \\cap B$</katex> is <katex>$\\min(|A|, |B|) = 3$</katex>. Thus, Statement (II) is true."
