    "If (2,3,-1) is the foot of the perpendicular from (4, 2, 1) to a plane, then the equation of the plane is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "$2x-y+2z=0$"
    ],
    [
      "$2x+y+2z-5=0$"

  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Normal vector $\\vec{n}$ connects the point to the foot: $(2-4, 3-2, -1-1) = (-2, 1, -2)$. Or $(2, -1, 2)$.",
    "Plane passes through foot (2,3,-1).",
    "$2(x-2) - 1(y-3) + 2(z+1) = 0$.",
    "$2x - 4 - y + 3 + 2z + 2 = 0 \\implies 2x - y + 2z + 1 = 0$."
