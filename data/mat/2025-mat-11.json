  "question": [
    "Let the functions f and g be <katex>$f:[0,\\frac{\\pi}{2}]\\rightarrow R$</katex> given by <katex>$f(x)=\\sin x$</katex> and <katex>$g:[0,\\frac{\\pi}{2}]\\rightarrow R$</katex> given by <katex>$g(x)=\\cos x$</katex>. Consider the following statements:",
    "Statement (I): f and g are one-one",
    "Statement (II): <katex>$f+g$</katex> is one-one",
    "Which of the following is correct?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Statement (I) is true, statement (II) is false"
    ],
    [
      "Statement (I) is false, statement (II) is true"
    ],
    [
      "Both statements (I) and (II) are true"
    ],
    [
      "Both statements (I) and (II) are false"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "In <katex>$[0, \\pi/2]$</katex>, <katex>$\\sin x$</katex> is strictly increasing, so it is one-one. <katex>$\\cos x$</katex> is strictly decreasing, so it is one-one. Statement I is true.",
    "Consider <katex>$h(x) = f(x) + g(x) = \\sin x + \\cos x$</katex>.",
    "<katex>$h(0) = 0 + 1 = 1$</katex>.",
    "<katex>$h(\\pi/2) = 1 + 0 = 1$</katex>.",
    "Since <katex>$h(0) = h(\\pi/2)$</katex>, <katex>$f+g$</katex> is not one-one. Statement II is false."
