    "Consider the following statements:",
    "Statement (I): If either $|\\vec{a}|=0$ or $|\\vec{b}|=0$, then $\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}=0$",
    "Statement (II): If $\\vec{a}\\times\\vec{b}=\\vec{0}$, then $\\vec{a}$ is perpendicular to $\\vec{b}$.",
    "Which of the following is correct?"
  ],

    [
      "Statement (I) is true but Statement (II) is false"

      "Both Statement (I) and Statement (II) is false"

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Statement I: If magnitude is 0, vector is zero vector. Dot product with zero vector is 0. True.",
    "Statement II: Cross product is zero implies vectors are parallel (or one is zero), not perpendicular. False."
