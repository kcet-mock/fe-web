  "question": [
    "The electronic configuration of X and Y are given below:",
    "X: 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p³",
    "Y: 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁵",
    "Which of the following is the correct molecular formula and type of bond formed between X and Y?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "X3Y, ionic bond"
    ],
    [
      "X2Y3, coordinate bond"
    ],
    [
      "XY3, covalent bond"
    ],
    [
      "X2Y, covalent bond"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "X is Phosphorus (P, valence 3/5) and Y is Chlorine (Cl, valence 1). They form PCl3 (XY3) or PCl5. The bond formed between two non-metals is covalent [cite: 513-527]."
