  "question": [
    "A pair of isoelectric species having bond order of one is:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "N₂, NO⁺"
    ],
    [
      "N₂, CO"
    ],
    [
      "F₂, O₂²⁻"
    ],
    [
      "CO, NO⁺"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Isoelectronic species have same number of electrons.",
    "F₂ (18e) and O₂²⁻ (18e) are isoelectronic.",
    "Bond order = (Nb - Na) / 2 = (10 - 8) / 2 = 1. Both have a single bond."
  ]
