  "question": [
    "The incorrect statement about Hall-Heroult process is :"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Carbon anode is oxidised to CO and CO₂"
    ],
    [
      "Na₃AlF₆ helps to decrease the melting point of the electrolyte"
    ],
    [
      "CaF₂ helps to increase the conductivity of the electrolyte"
    ],
    [
      "Oxidation state of oxygen changes in the overall cell reaction"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "In the Hall-Heroult process, Alumina (Al₂O₃) is reduced.",
    "The reaction at the anode involves Oxide ions (O²⁻) reacting with Carbon to form CO and CO₂. The oxidation state of oxygen is -2 in Al₂O₃ and remains -2 in CO and CO₂. Thus, the oxidation state of oxygen does *not* change. (Carbon changes from 0 to +2/+4; Aluminum changes from +3 to 0)."
