  "question": [
    "The correct decreasing order of boiling point of hydrogen halides is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "HF > HCl > HBr > HI"
    ],
    [
      "HI > HBr > HCl > HF"
    ],
    [
      "HF > HI > HBr > HCl"
    ],
    [
      "HI > HF > HBr > HCl"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "HF has the highest boiling point due to strong intermolecular Hydrogen bonding.",
    "For the rest (HCl, HBr, HI), boiling point increases with molecular mass (Van der Waals forces): HCl < HBr < HI.",
    "Combining these: HF > HI > HBr > HCl."
