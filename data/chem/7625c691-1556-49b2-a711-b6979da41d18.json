  "choices": [
    [
      "It is difficult to identify the end point"
    ],
    [
      "Nitric acid doesn't act as an indicator"
    ],
    [
      "Nitric acid itself is an oxidizing agent"

  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Nitric acid (<katex>$HNO_3$</katex>) is a strong oxidizing agent and would interfere with the redox titration by oxidizing <katex>$Fe^{2+}$</katex> itself."
