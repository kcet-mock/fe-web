  "question": [
    "For the reaction PCl₅ → PCl₃ + Cl₂, rate and rate constant are 1.02×10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹ s⁻¹ and 3.4×10⁻⁵ s⁻¹ respectively at a given instant. The molar concentration of PCl₅ at that instant is:"

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Unit of rate constant (s⁻¹) indicates First Order reaction.",
    "Rate = k [PCl₅]¹.",
    "[PCl₅] = Rate / k = (1.02 × 10⁻⁴) / (3.4 × 10⁻⁵) = 10.2 / 3.4 = 3.0 mol L⁻¹."
