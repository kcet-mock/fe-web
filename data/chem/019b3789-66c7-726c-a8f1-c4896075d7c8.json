  "question": [
    "Statement - I: Reduction of ester by DIBAL-H followed by hydrolysis gives aldehyde.",
    "Statement - II: Oxidation of benzyl alcohol with aqueous KMnO4 leads to the formation to Benzaldehyde.",
    "Identify the correct statement."
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Both statements - I and II are false"
    ],
    [
      "Statement - I is true but statement - II is false"
    ],
    [
      "Statement - I is false but statement - II is true"
    ],
    [
      "Both statements - I and II are true"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Statement I is true (DIBAL-H reduces esters to aldehydes). Statement II is false because strong oxidizers like KMnO4 oxidise benzyl alcohol directly to Benzoic acid, not benzaldehyde [cite: 932-941]."
