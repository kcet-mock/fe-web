  "question": [
    "180g of glucose, C6H12O6, is dissolved in 1 kg of water in a vessel. The temperature at which water boils at 1.013 bar is ______ (given, Kb for water is 0.52 K kg mol-1. Boiling point for pure water is 373.15K)"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "373.67 K"
    ],
    [
      "373.015 K"
    ],
    [
      "373.0 K"
    ],
    [
      "373.202 K"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Moles glucose = 180/180 = 1 mol. Molality = 1m. delta Tb = 0.52 * 1 = 0.52 K. Tb = 373.15 + 0.52 = 373.67 K [cite: 1031-1033]."
