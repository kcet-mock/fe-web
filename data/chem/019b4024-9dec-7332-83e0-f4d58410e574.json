  "question": [
    "For the formation of which compound in Ellingham diagram $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ becomes more and more negative with increase in temperature?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "ZnO"
    ],
    [
      "$Cu_2O$"
    ],
    [
      "CO"
    ],
    [
      "FeO"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "In the reaction $2C + O_2 \\rightarrow 2CO$, there is an increase in the number of moles of gas (1 mole gas to 2 moles gas).",
    "Entropy change ($\\Delta S$) is positive. Since $\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S$, as T increases, the $-T\\Delta S$ term becomes more negative, making $\\Delta G$ more negative. The slope is downwards."
