  "question": [
    "Sucrose is dextrorotatory but after hydrolysis the mixture shows laevorotation, this is because of:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Recemic mixture is formed."
    ],
    [
      "Laevorotation of fructose is more than dextrorotation of glucose."
    ],
    [
      "Laevorotation of glucose is more than dextrorotation of fructose."
    ],
    [
      "Sucrose is a non-reducing sugar"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Hydrolysis of sucrose yields D-Glucose (dextrorotatory, $+52.5^{\\circ}$) and D-Fructose (laevorotatory, $-92.4^{\\circ}$).",
    "The magnitude of laevorotation of fructose is greater than the dextrorotation of glucose, resulting in a net laevorotation for the mixture (invert sugar)."
