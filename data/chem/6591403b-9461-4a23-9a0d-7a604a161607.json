    "Propanone and Propanal are:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Position isomers"
    ],
    [
      "Functional isomers"

  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Propanone (<katex>$CH_3COCH_3$</katex>) contains a ketone group, while propanal (<katex>$CH_3CH_2CHO$</katex>) contains an aldehyde group. Since they have the same molecular formula (<katex>$C_3H_6O$</katex>) but different functional groups, they are functional isomers."
