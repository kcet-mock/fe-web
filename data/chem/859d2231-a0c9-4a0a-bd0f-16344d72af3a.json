  "question": [
    "In the reaction",
    "Aniline <katex>$\\xrightarrow{NaNO_2/dil. HCl}$</katex> P <katex>$\\xrightarrow{Phenol/NaOH}$</katex> Q.",
    "'Q' is:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "<katex>$C_{6}H_{5}N_{2}Cl$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "ortho-hydroxyazobenzene"
    ],
    [
      "para-hydroxyazobenzene"
    ],
    [
      "meta-hydroxyazobenzene"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Aniline reacts with <katex>$NaNO_2/HCl$</katex> to form benzene diazonium chloride (P). Coupling of (P) with phenol in an alkaline medium (NaOH) occurs predominantly at the para-position to form p-hydroxyazobenzene (Q), which is an orange dye."
