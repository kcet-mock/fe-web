  "question": [
    "Match List-I with List-II for the following reaction pattern of Glucose:",
    "List-I (Reagents): a. Acetic anhydride, b. Bromine water, c. Hydroiodic acid, d. Hydrogen cyanide",
    "List-II (Structural prediction): i. Glucose has an aldehyde group, ii. Glucose has a straight chain of six carbon atoms, iii. Glucose has five hydroxyl group, iv. Glucose has a carbonyl group"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "a-iv, b-iii, c-ii, d-i"
    ],
    [
      "a-iii, b-i, c-ii, d-iv"

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "a. Acetic anhydride -> Pentaacetate (5 -OH groups) [iii]",
    "b. Bromine water -> Gluconic acid (Aldehyde group) [i]",
    "c. HI -> n-Hexane (Straight chain) [ii]",
    "d. HCN -> Cyanohydrin (Carbonyl group) [iv] [cite: 645-659]."
