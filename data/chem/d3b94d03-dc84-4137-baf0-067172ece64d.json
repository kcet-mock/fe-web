  "question": [
    "If ethane-1,2-diamine (en) is added to <katex>$[Ni(H_{2}O)_{6}]^{2+}$</katex>, complexes I (<katex>$[Ni(H_{2}O)_{4}en]^{2+}$</katex>) and III (<katex>$[Ni(en)_{3}]^{2+}$</katex>) are formed. The wavelength of light absorbed in I and III are respectively:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "310nm and 500nm"
    ],
    [
      "600nm and 535nm"
    ],
    [
      "475nm and 310nm"
    ],
    [
      "300nm and 475nm"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "The ligand strength of 'en' is greater than <katex>$H_2O$</katex>. Complex III has a larger crystal field splitting than Complex I, so it absorbs higher energy (shorter wavelength). <katex>$\\lambda_{I} > \\lambda_{III}$</katex>."
