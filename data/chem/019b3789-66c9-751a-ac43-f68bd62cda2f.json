  "question": [
    "If N2 gas is bubbled through water at 293 K, how many moles of N2 gas would dissolve in 1 litre of water? Assume that N2 exerts a partial pressure of 0.987 bar. [Given KH for N2 at 293 K is 76.48 K bar]"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "0.716 * 10^-3"
    ],
    [
      "57.16 * 10^-3"
    ],
    [
      "4.716 * 10^-3"
    ],
    [
      "7.16 * 10^-4"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Note: Text options are garbled/ambiguous, but solution derives 7.16 x 10^-4. Option 3 is selected in key, though text in snippet 1034 looks different. Calculation: X = P/KH = 0.987/76480 = 1.29e-5. n = 55.5 * 1.29e-5 = 7.16e-4. We will assume option 3 corresponds to the correct value [cite: 1033-1037]."
