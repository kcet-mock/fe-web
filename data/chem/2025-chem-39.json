  "question": [
    "Given below are two statements.",
    "Statement-I: Adiabatic work done is positive when work is done on the system and internal energy of the system increases.",
    "Statement-II: No work is done during free expansion of an ideal gas.",
    "In the light of the above statements, choose the correct answer."
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Both statements - I and Statement - II are false"
    ],
    [
      "Statement - I is true but statement - II is false"
    ],
    [
      "Statement - I is false but statement - II is true"
    ],
    [
      "Both statements - I and Statement - II are true"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "For adiabatic process, <katex>$q=0$</katex>. Work done on the system increases <katex>$\\Delta U$</katex> (<katex>$\\Delta U = W$</katex>).",
    "Free expansion means expansion against zero external pressure, so <katex>$W = -P_{ext}\\Delta V = 0$</katex>."
