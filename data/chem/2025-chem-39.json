  "question": [
    "Given below are two statements.",
    "Statement-I: Adiabatic work done is positive when work is done on the system and internal energy of the system increases.",
    "Statement-II: No work is done during free expansion of an ideal gas.",
    "In the light of the above statements, choose the correct answer from the options given below."
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Both statements - I and Statement - II are false"
    ],
    [
      "Statement - I is true but statement - II is false"
    ],
    [
      "Statement - I is false but statement - II is true"
    ],
    [
      "Both statements - I and Statement - II are true"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "In an adiabatic process (<katex>$q=0$</katex>), <katex>$\\Delta U = w$</katex>. Work done on the system is positive, increasing internal energy.",
    "Free expansion means expansion against zero external pressure (<katex>$P_{ext}=0$</katex>), so Work (<katex>$w = -P_{ext}\\Delta V$</katex>) is zero."
