  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "'50 volume' hydrogen peroxide"
    ],
    [
      "'100 volume' hydrogen peroxide"
    ],
    [
      "'30 volume' hydrogen peroxide"
    ],

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "30% <katex>$H_2O_2$</katex> solution means 30g per 100mL (approx). Molarity ~ 8.8 M. Volume strength = <katex>$11.2 \\times M \\approx 100$</katex> volumes. Thus, it is known as '100 volume' hydrogen peroxide."
