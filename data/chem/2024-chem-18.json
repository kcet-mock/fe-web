    "images/2024-chem-18-1.png",
    "X, Y and Z respectively are: [cite: 132-144]"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "AgF, alcoholic KOH and benzene"
    ],
    [
      "HF, aqueous KOH and Na in dry ether"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$Hg_{2}F_{2}$</katex>, alcoholic KOH and Na in dry ether"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$CoF_{2}$</katex> aqueous KOH and benzene"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "X: Swarts reaction uses <katex>$Hg_2F_2$</katex> to convert alkyl chloride to fluoride. Y: Alcoholic KOH causes dehydrohalogenation to form ethene. Z: Wurtz reaction with Na in dry ether forms butane. [cite: 146, 147]"
