  "question": [
    "Y in the following reaction is",
    "<katex>$$Phenol \\xrightarrow{NaOH} A \\xrightarrow[(ii)H^+]{(i)CO_2} B \\xrightarrow[(ii)H^+]{(i)(CH_3CO)_2O} Y \\text{ (Major product)}$$</katex>"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Cumene"
    ],
    [
      "Picric acid"
    ],
    [
      "Salicylaldehyde"
    ],
    [
      "Aspirin"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "1. Phenol reacts with NaOH to form Sodium Phenoxide.",
    "2. Sodium Phenoxide reacts with <katex>$CO_2$</katex> followed by acidification (Kolbe's reaction) to form Salicylic acid (B).",
    "3. Salicylic acid reacts with Acetic anhydride (<katex>$(CH_3CO)_2O$</katex>) in acidic medium (Acetylation) to form Acetylsalicylic acid.",
    "4. Acetylsalicylic acid is commonly known as **Aspirin** (Y)."
