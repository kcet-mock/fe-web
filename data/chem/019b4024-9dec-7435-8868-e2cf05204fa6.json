  "question": [
    "In which one of the following reactions, rate constant has the unit mol $L^{-1}s^{-1}$?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "$2NO_{(g)}+O_{2_{(g)}}\\rightarrow2NO_{2_{(g)}}$"
    ],
    [
      "Decomposition of HI on the surface of Gold"
    ],
    [
      "Acid catalysed hydrolysis of $CH_{3}COOCH_{3}$"
    ],
    [
      "$CHCl_{3}+Cl_{2}\\rightarrow CCl_{4}+HCl$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "The unit $mol~L^{-1}~s^{-1}$ corresponds to a Zero Order reaction.",
    "Decomposition of gases on metal surfaces (like HI on Gold) at high pressure is typically a Zero Order reaction."
