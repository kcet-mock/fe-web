  "question": [
    "For the formation of which compound in Ellingham diagram <katex>$\\Delta G^{\\circ}$</katex> becomes more and more negative with increase in temperature ?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "ZnO"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$Cu_{2}O$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "CO"
    ],
    [
      "FeO"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "In the Ellingham diagram, the slope is equal to <katex>$-\\Delta S$</katex>.",
    "For the reaction <katex>$2C(s) + O_2(g) \\rightarrow 2CO(g)$</katex>, there is an increase in the number of gaseous moles (<katex>$\\Delta n_g = 1$</katex>), so entropy increases (<katex>$\\Delta S > 0$</katex>).",
    "Since <katex>$\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S$</katex>, as T increases, the <katex>$-T\\Delta S$</katex> term becomes more negative.",
    "Thus, the line for **CO** slopes downwards (becomes more negative)."
