  "question": [
    "Which of the following is CORRECT with respect to melting point of a transition element?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "<katex>$Mn>Fe$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$Ti>V$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$V>Cr$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$Cr>Mn$</katex>"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Manganese (Mn) has an anomalously low melting point compared to its neighbors (Cr and Fe) due to stable half-filled d-orbitals which lead to weaker metallic bonding.",
    "Chromium (Cr) has a much higher melting point.",
    "So, <katex>$Cr > Mn$</katex> is correct."
