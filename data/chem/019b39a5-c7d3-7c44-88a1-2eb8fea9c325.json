  "question": [
    "For the coagulation of positively charged hydrated ferric-oxide sol, the flocculating power of the ions is in the order:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "PO₄³⁻ > SO₄²⁻ > Cl⁻ > [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻"
    ],
    [
      "Cl⁻ > SO₄²⁻ > PO₄³⁻ > [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻"
    ],
    [
      "SO₄²⁻ = Cl⁻ = PO₄³⁻ = [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻"
    ],
    [
      "[Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻ > PO₄³⁻ > SO₄²⁻ > Cl⁻"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "According to Hardy-Schulze rule, the flocculating power increases with the valency of the counter-ion.",
    "For a positively charged sol, we need negative ions.",
    "Valencies: [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻ (-4), PO₄³⁻ (-3), SO₄²⁻ (-2), Cl⁻ (-1).",
    "Order: 4 > 3 > 2 > 1."
