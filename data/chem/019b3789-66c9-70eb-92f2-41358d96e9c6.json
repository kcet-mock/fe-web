  "question": [
    "The correct statement/s about Galvanic cell is/are",
    "(a) Current flows from cathode to anode",
    "(b) Anode is positive terminal",
    "(c) If cell E < 0, then it is spontaneous reaction",
    "(d) Cathode is positive terminal"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "a and b only"
    ],
    [
      "a, b and c"
    ],
    [
      "a and d only"
    ],
    [
      "b only"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "In a Galvanic cell, the anode is negative, cathode is positive. Current flows from cathode to anode (electrons flow anode to cathode). E_cell > 0 for spontaneous [cite: 1037-1040]."
