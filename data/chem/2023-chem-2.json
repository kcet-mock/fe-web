    "Aniline does not undergo"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Friedel-Craft reaction"
    ],
    [
      "Bromination"
    ],
    [
      "Nitration"

    [
      "Sulphonation"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Aniline does not undergo Friedel-Crafts reaction.",
    "This is because aniline is a Lewis base (due to the lone pair on Nitrogen) and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (<katex>$AlCl_3$</katex>) used in Friedel-Crafts reactions to form a salt.",
    "This deactivates the benzene ring towards electrophilic substitution."
