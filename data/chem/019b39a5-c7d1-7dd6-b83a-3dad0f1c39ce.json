  "question": [
    "Which one of the following nitrate will decompose to give NO₂ on heating?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "NaNO₃"
    ],
    [
      "KNO₃"
    ],
    [
      "RbNO₃"
    ],
    [
      "LiNO₃"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Alkali metal nitrates usually decompose to nitrite and oxygen (e.g., 2NaNO₃ → 2NaNO₂ + O₂).",
    "Exception: Lithium Nitrate (LiNO₃) behaves like magnesium nitrate due to diagonal relationship/small size of Li⁺.",
    "4LiNO₃ → 2Li₂O + 4NO₂ + O₂. It releases Brown NO₂ gas."
