  "question": [
    "Given below are the atomic masses of the elements:",
    "Li (7), Na (23), K (39), Ca (40), Cl (35.5), Br (80), Sr (88), I (127), Ba (137)",
    "Which of the following doesn't form triad?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Ba, Sr, Ca"
    ],
    [
      "Cl, Br, I"
    ],
    [
      "Cl, K, Ca"
    ],
    [
      "Li, Na, K"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Dobereiner's triads consist of elements with similar chemical properties where the middle element's mass is the average of the others.",
    "Li, Na, K is a triad.",
    "Ca, Sr, Ba is a triad.",
    "Cl, Br, I is a triad.",
    "Cl (Non-metal), K (Metal), Ca (Metal) do not form a triad chemically."
