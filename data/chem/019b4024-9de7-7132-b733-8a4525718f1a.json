  "question": [
    "The heating of phenyl methyl ether with HI produces an aromatic compound A which on treatment with con. $HNO_3$ gives B. A and B respectively are:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Iodobenzene, 1-Iodo-4-nitrobenzene"
    ],
    [
      "Phenol, Picric acid"
    ],
    [
      "Methanol, Ethanoic acid"
    ],
    [
      "Picric acid, Phenol"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "1. Cleavage of Phenyl methyl ether (Anisole) with HI gives Phenol (A) and Methyl iodide (due to the stronger aryl-oxygen bond).",
    "2. Treatment of Phenol (A) with concentrated $HNO_3$ results in nitration at ortho and para positions, specifically leading to 2,4,6-trinitrophenol, commonly known as Picric acid (B)."
