  "question": [
    "Which of the following halides cannot be hydrolysed?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "CCl₄"
    ],
    [
      "SiCl₄"
    ],
    [
      "GeCl₄"
    ],
    [
      "SnCl₄"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Hydrolysis requires the central atom to accept lone pairs from water into vacant d-orbitals.",
    "Carbon (in CCl₄) does not have vacant d-orbitals in its valence shell (Period 2).",
    "Si, Ge, and Sn (Period 3+) have vacant d-orbitals and can be hydrolysed."
