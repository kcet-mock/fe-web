  "question": [
    "A pair of compounds having the same boiling points are"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Benzene and naphthalene"
    ],
    [
      "(+) butan-2-ol and (-) butan-2-ol"
    ],
    [
      "cis but-2-ene and trans but-2-ene"
    ],
    [
      "n-hexane and neo-hexane"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Enantiomers have identical physical properties (boiling point, melting point, density, refractive index) in an achiral environment.",
    "**(+) butan-2-ol and (-) butan-2-ol** are enantiomers, so they have the same boiling point."
