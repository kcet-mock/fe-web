  "question": [
    "The electronic configuration of X and Y are given below:",
    "X: <katex>$1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}3s^{2}3p^{3}$</katex>",
    "Y: <katex>$1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}3s^{2}3p^{5}$</katex>",
    "Which of the following is the correct molecular formula and type of bond formed between X and Y?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "<katex>$X_{3}Y$</katex>, ionic bond"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$X_{2}Y_{3}$</katex>, coordinate bond"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$XY_{3}$</katex>, covalent bond"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$X_{2}Y$</katex>, covalent bond"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "X is Phosphorus (P) with valency 3 or 5.",
    "Y is Chlorine (Cl) with valency 1.",
    "Possible molecules are <katex>$PCl_{3}$</katex> or <katex>$PCl_{5}$</katex>.",
    "The bond formed between two non-metals is covalent.",
    "Therefore, <katex>$XY_{3}$</katex> with a covalent bond is correct."
