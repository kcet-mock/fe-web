  "question": [
    "In which one of the following pairs, both the elements does not have $(n-1)d^{10}ns^2$ configuration in its elementary state?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Hg, Cn"
    ],
    [
      "Cu, Zn"
    ],
    [
      "Zn, Cd"
    ],
    [
      "Cd, Hg"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "General configuration for Group 12 (Zn, Cd, Hg, Cn) is $(n-1)d^{10} ns^2$.",
    "Cu (Group 11) has configuration $(n-1)d^{10} ns^1$.",
    "So the pair (Cu, Zn) contains Cu which does not fit the $d^{10} s^2$ pattern. Note: The source marked this as 'No Answer', possibly due to ambiguous phrasing ('both... does not'), but Cu is the clear outlier among the options."
