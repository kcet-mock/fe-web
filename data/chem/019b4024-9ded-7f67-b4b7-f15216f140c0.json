  "question": [
    "For Freundlich adsorption isotherm, a graph of $\\log(x/m)$ Vs. $\\log(P)$ gives a straight line. The slope of line and its Y-axis intercept respectively are:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "$\\log(1/n), \\log K$"
    ],
    [
      "$1/n, K$"
    ],
    [
      "$\\log(1/n), K$"
    ],
    [
      "$1/n, \\log K$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Freundlich equation: $x/m = K P^{1/n}$.",
    "Log form: $\\log(x/m) = \\log K + \\frac{1}{n} \\log P$.",
    "Comparing to $y = c + mx$: Slope = $1/n$, Intercept = $\\log K$."
