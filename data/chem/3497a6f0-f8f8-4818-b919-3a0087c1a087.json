  "question": [
    "Which one of the following properties is generally not applicable to ionic hydrides?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Non-volatile"
    ],
    [
      "Non-conducting in solid state"
    ],
    [
      "Crystalline"
    ],
    [
      "Volatile"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Ionic hydrides (like NaH, CaH2) are solid, crystalline, non-volatile compounds with high melting points. They conduct electricity in the molten state but not in the solid state. Being 'Volatile' is characteristic of covalent hydrides."
