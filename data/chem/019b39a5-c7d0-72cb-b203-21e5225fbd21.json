  "question": [
    "Which of the following statements are true about [CoF₆]³⁻ ion? I. The complex has octahedral geometry. II. Coordination number of Co is 3 and oxidation state is + 6. III. The complex is sp³d² hybridised. IV. It is a high spin complex."
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "I, II and IV"
    ],
    [
      "I, III and IV"
    ],
    [
      "II and IV"
    ],
    [
      "II, III and IV"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Co is in +3 oxidation state (x - 6 = -3 → x=+3). Configuration is 3d⁶.",
    "F⁻ is a weak field ligand, so it does not cause pairing. It forms an outer orbital complex.",
    "Hybridization is sp³d² (Outer orbital).",
    "Geometry is Octahedral (CN=6).",
    "It is High Spin (due to weak ligand).",
    "Statement II is false (CN is 6, not 3; OS is +3, not +6).",
    "Statements I, III, IV are true."
