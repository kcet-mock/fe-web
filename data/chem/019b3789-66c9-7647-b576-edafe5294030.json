  "question": [
    "Among the following 0.1 m aqueous solutions, which one will exhibit the lowest boiling point elevation, assuming complete ionization of the compound in solution?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Aluminium chloride"
    ],
    [
      "Aluminmium sulphate"
    ],
    [
      "Potassium sulphate"
    ],
    [
      "Sodium chloride"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Boiling point elevation depends on van't Hoff factor (i). NaCl (i=2), K2SO4 (i=3), AlCl3 (i=4), Al2(SO4)3 (i=5). NaCl has the lowest 'i', thus lowest elevation [cite: 1023-1029]."
