  "question": [
    "Which one of the following properties is generally not applicable to ionic hydrides?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Non-volatile"
    ],
    [
      "Non-conducting in solid state"
    ],
    [
      "Crystalline"
    ],
    [
      "Volatile"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Ionic hydrides (like NaH, CaH₂) are salt-like, crystalline solids.",
    "They have high melting points and are non-volatile.",
    "They conduct electricity in molten state but not in solid state.",
    "Therefore, 'Volatile' is the incorrect property."
  ]
