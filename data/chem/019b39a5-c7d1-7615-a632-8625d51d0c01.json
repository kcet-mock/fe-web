  "question": [
    "2-Methyl propane can be prepared by Wurtz reaction. The haloalkanes taken along with metallic sodium and dry ether are:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "chloromethane and 2-chloropropane"
    ],
    [
      "chloroethane and chloromethane"
    ],
    [
      "chloroethane and 1-chloropropane"
    ],
    [
      "chloromethane and 1-chloropropane"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "2-Methylpropane is Isobutane: CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH₃.",
    "Wurtz reaction couples two alkyl halides.",
    "Coupling Isopropyl chloride (2-chloropropane) and Methyl chloride (chloromethane) can yield Isobutane (along with other products like ethane and 2,3-dimethylbutane).",
    "CH₃Cl + CH₃-CH(Cl)-CH₃ → CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH₃."
