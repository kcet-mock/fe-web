  "question": [
    "In which one of the following pairs, both the elements does not have <katex>$(n-1)d^{10}ns^{2}$</katex> configuration in its elementary state?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Hg, Cn"
    ],
    [
      "Cu, Zn"
    ],
    [

      "Cd, Hg"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Zn, Cd, Hg, and Cn are Group 12 elements with <katex>$(n-1)d^{10}ns^{2}$</katex> configuration. Cu is Group 11 with <katex>$3d^{10}4s^1$</katex>. The pair 'Cu, Zn' contains an element (Cu) that does not have the <katex>$(n-1)d^{10}ns^{2}$</katex> configuration."
