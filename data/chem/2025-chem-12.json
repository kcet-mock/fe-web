    "Match List-I with List-II for the following reaction pattern of Glucose:",
    "| List-I (Reagents) | List-II (Structural prediction) |",
    "|---|---|",
    "| a. Acetic anhydride | i. Glucose has an aldehyde group |",
    "| b. Bromine water | ii. Glucose has a straight chain of six carbon atoms |",
    "| c. Hydroiodic acid | iii. Glucose has five hydroxyl group |",
    "| d. Hydrogen cyanide | iv. Glucose has a carbonyl group |"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "a-iv, b-iii, c-ii, d-i"
    ],
    [
      "a-iii, b-i, c-ii, d-iv"
    ],
    [
      "a-i, b-ii, c-iii, d-iv"
    ],
    [
      "a-iii, b-ii, c-i, d-iv"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Acetylation with acetic anhydride confirms 5 -OH groups (a-iii).",
    "Oxidation with Bromine water (mild oxidant) confirms aldehyde group (b-i).",
    "Reduction with HI confirms straight carbon chain (c-ii).",
    "Reaction with HCN confirms carbonyl group (d-iv)."
