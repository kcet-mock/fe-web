    "Match List-I with List-II for the following reaction pattern: Glucose + Reagent -> Product",
    "| List-I (Reagents) | List-II (Structural prediction) |\n|---|---|\n| a. Acetic anhydride | i. Glucose has an aldehyde group |\n| b. Bromine water | ii. Glucose has a straight chain of six carbon atoms |\n| c. Hydroiodic acid | iii. Glucose has five hydroxyl groups |\n| d. Hydrogen cyanide | iv. Glucose has a carbonyl group |"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "a-iv, b-iii, c-ii, d-i"
    ],
    [
      "a-iii, b-i, c-ii, d-iv"
    ],
    [
      "a-i, b-ii, c-iii, d-iv"
    ],
    [
      "a-iii, b-ii, c-i, d-iv"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Acetic anhydride reacts with OH groups -> confirms 5 OH groups (iii).",
    "Bromine water oxidizes aldehyde -> confirms aldehyde group (i).",
    "Hydroiodic acid reduces to n-hexane -> confirms straight chain (ii).",
    "HCN forms cyanohydrin -> confirms carbonyl group (iv)."
