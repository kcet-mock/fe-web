  "question": [
    "In the analysis of III group basic radicals of salts, the purpose of adding NH₄Cl(s) to NH₄OH is:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "To increase the concentration of OH⁻ ions."
    ],
    [
      "To precipitate the radicals of group IV and V."
    ],
    [
      "To suppress the dissociation of NH₄OH."
    ],
    [
      "To introduce Cl⁻ ions."
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "This works on the common ion effect.",
    "NH₄Cl provides NH₄⁺ ions, which suppresses the ionization of the weak base NH₄OH.",
    "This lowers the [OH⁻] concentration, ensuring only Group III hydroxides (like Al(OH)₃, Fe(OH)₃, Cr(OH)₃) precipitate, as they have very low solubility products (Ksp). Group IV/V hydroxides require higher [OH⁻] to precipitate."
