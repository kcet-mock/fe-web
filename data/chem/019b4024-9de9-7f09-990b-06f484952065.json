    "Match the List-I with List-II:",
    "1. Caprolactum -> (a) Nylon-6",
    "2. Vinyl chloride -> (b) Polystyrene",
    "3. Styrene -> (c) PVC",
    "4. Propene -> (d) Polypropene",
    "(Note: Structures were provided in original, mapped to names here for clarity)"

    [
      "1-d, 2-c, 3-a, 4-b"

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "1. Caprolactum is the monomer for Nylon-6 (structure d in source).",
    "2. Vinyl chloride is the monomer for PVC (structure c in source).",
    "3. Styrene is the monomer for Polystyrene (structure b in source).",
    "4. Propene is the monomer for Polypropene (structure a in source).",
    "*Correction based on source key B*: The source maps Caprolactum to structure d (Nylon 6 polymer), Vinyl Chloride to c, etc."
