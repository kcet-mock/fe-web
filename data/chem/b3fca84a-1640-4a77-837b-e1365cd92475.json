  "question": [
    "Sodium ethanoate on heating with soda lime give 'X'. Electrolysis of aqueous solution of sodium ethanoate gives 'Y', 'X' and 'Y' respectively are:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Methane and Ethane"
    ],
    [
      "Methane and Methane"
    ],
    [
      "Ethane and Methane"
    ],
    [
      "Ethane and Ethane"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Decarboxylation of sodium ethanoate with soda lime produces methane ('X'). Kolbe's electrolysis of aqueous sodium ethanoate produces ethane ('Y') at the anode. Therefore, X is Methane and Y is Ethane."
