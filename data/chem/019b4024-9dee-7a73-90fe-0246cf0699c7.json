  "question": [
    "The correct decreasing order of basicity of hydrides of Group - 15 elements is:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "$AsH_3 > SbH_3 > NH_3 > PH_3$"
    ],
    [
      "$NH_3 > PH_3 > AsH_3 > SbH_3$"
    ],
    [
      "$SbH_3 > AsH_3 > PH_3 > NH_3$"
    ],
    [
      "$PH_3 > AsH_3 > SbH_3 > NH_3$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Basicity decreases down the group as the size of the central atom increases, decreasing the electron density and availability of the lone pair.",
    "Order: $NH_3 > PH_3 > AsH_3 > SbH_3$."
