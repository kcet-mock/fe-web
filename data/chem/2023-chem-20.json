  "question": [
    "The number of protons, neutrons and electrons in the ion <katex>${}_{16}^{32}S^{2-}$</katex> respectively are"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "18, 16, 16"
    ],
    [
      "16, 16, 16"
    ],
    [
      "16, 18, 16"
    ],
    [
      "16, 16, 18"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Atomic number (Z) = 16 (Protons).",
    "Mass number (A) = 32.",
    "Neutrons = A - Z = 32 - 16 = 16.",
    "Electrons = Protons + Charge = 16 + 2 = 18 (since charge is 2-).",
    "Order: Protons, Neutrons, Electrons -> 16, 16, 18."
