  "question": [
    "Match List-I (Reagents) with List-II (Structural prediction) for Glucose:",
    "a. Acetic anhydride, b. Bromine water, c. Hydroiodic acid, d. Hydrogen cyanide",
    "i. Glucose has an aldehyde group",
    "ii. Glucose has a straight chain of six carbon atoms",
    "iii. Glucose has five hydroxyl group",
    "iv. Glucose has a carbonyl group"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "a-iv, b-iii, c-ii, d-i"
    ],
    [
      "a-iii, b-i, c-ii, d-iv"
    ],
    [
      "a-i, b-ii, c-iii, d-iv"

    [
      "a-iii, b-ii, c-i, d-iv"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Acetic anhydride forms pentaacetate -> 5 -OH groups (a-iii).",
    "Bromine water oxidizes aldehyde -> Aldehyde group (b-i).",
    "HI reduces to n-hexane -> Straight chain (c-ii).",
    "HCN forms cyanohydrin -> Carbonyl group (d-iv)."
