  "question": [
    "At 500 K, for a reversible reaction $A_{2(g)}+B_{2(g)} \\rightleftharpoons 2AB_{(g)}$ in a closed container, $K_{C}=2\\times10^{-5}$. In the presence of catalyst, the equilibrium is attaining 10 times faster. The equilibrium constant $K_{C}$ in the presence of catalyst at the same temperature is:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "$2\\times10^{-10}$"
    ],
    [
      "$2\\times10^{-5}$"
    ],
    [
      "$2\\times10^{-4}$"
    ],
    [
      "$2\\times10^{-6}$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "A catalyst increases the rate of both forward and backward reactions equally.",
    "It does not alter the value of the equilibrium constant ($K_C$).",
    "Therefore, $K_C$ remains $2\\times10^{-5}$."
