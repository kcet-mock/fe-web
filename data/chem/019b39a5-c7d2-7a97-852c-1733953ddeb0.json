  "question": [
    "A mixture of phenol and aniline shows negative deviation from Raoult's law. This is due to the formation of:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Polar covalent bond"
    ],
    [
      "Non-polar covalent bond"
    ],
    [
      "Intermolecular Hydrogen bond"
    ],
    [
      "Intramolecular Hydrogen bond"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Negative deviation occurs when attractive forces between unlike molecules (A-B) are stronger than those between like molecules.",
    "Phenol (acidic proton) and Aniline (basic nitrogen lone pair) form strong intermolecular Hydrogen bonds, decreasing the vapour pressure."
