    "A haloalkane undergoes Sₙ1 or Sₙ2 reaction depending on :"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Solvent used in the reaction"
    ],
    [
      "Low temperature"
    ],
    [

    [
      "Stability of the haloalkane"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "While the structure of the substrate is the primary factor (primary vs tertiary), the solvent plays a crucial role.",
    "Polar protic solvents favor Sₙ1 (stabilize carbocation).",
    "Polar aprotic solvents favor Sₙ2.",
    "Given the options, the solvent is a key determinant for the mechanism pathway."
