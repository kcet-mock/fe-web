  "question": [
    "In the reaction Aniline → NaNO₂/dil HCl → P → Phenol/NaOH → Q. 'Q' is:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "C₆H₅N₂Cl"
    ],
    [
      "ortho-hydroxyazobenzene"
    ],
    [
      "para-hydroxyazobenzene"
    ],
    [
      "meta-hydroxyazobenzene"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Aniline reacts with NaNO₂/HCl to form Benzene Diazonium Chloride (P).",
    "P undergoes a coupling reaction with Phenol in a basic medium (NaOH).",
    "Coupling occurs primarily at the para position of phenol (due to steric hindrance at ortho), forming p-hydroxyazobenzene (an orange dye)."
