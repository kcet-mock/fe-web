  "question": [
    "Which of the following statements are true about <katex>$[CoF_{6}]^{3-}$</katex> ion?",
    "I. The complex has octahedral geometry.",
    "II. Coordination number of Co is 3 and oxidation state is + 6.",
    "III. The complex is <katex>$sp^{3}d^{2}$</katex> hybridised.",
    "IV. It is a high spin complex."
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "I, II and IV"
    ],
    [
      "I, III and IV"
    ],
    [
      "II and IV"
    ],
    [
      "II, III and IV"

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "The <katex>$[CoF_6]^{3-}$</katex> ion contains <katex>$Co^{3+}$</katex>. Fluoride is a weak field ligand, forming a high spin outer orbital complex. The hybridization is <katex>$sp^3d^2$</katex>, geometry is octahedral, and Co has a coordination number of 6."
