  "question": [
    "Which one of the following pairs will show positive deviation from Raoult's Law?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Water - HCl"
    ],
    [
      "Benzene - Methanol"
    ],
    [

    ],
    [
      "Acetone - Chloroform"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Positive deviation occurs when A-B interactions are weaker than A-A and B-B interactions.",
    "Methanol has strong H-bonding. Adding benzene breaks these H-bonds, increasing vapour pressure (Positive Deviation).",
    "Water-acids and Acetone-Chloroform show negative deviation."
