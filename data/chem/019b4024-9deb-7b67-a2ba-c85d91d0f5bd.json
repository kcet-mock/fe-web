  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Arrhenius equation: $k = A e^{-E_a/RT}$.",
    "As $T \\rightarrow \\infty$, $E_a/RT \\rightarrow 0$, so $e^0 = 1$.",
    "Thus, $k \\rightarrow A$. But the question asks for value of A given k at 300K? Wait. If $T \\rightarrow \\infty$, $k$ becomes $A$. The question asks for A. It implies $A$ is independent of T. Usually $k$ at specific T is given. If $k = 6\\times 10^5$, then $A = k / e^{-Ea/RT}$. Answer B suggests $A \\approx k$. This implies activation energy is zero or the question assumes $k$ doesn't change? Or, simply $A$ is the frequency factor. If the question implies 'What is the limit of k as T->inf', it is A. The source key B implies the value is just the number given. This is physically only true if Ea=0. Without Ea, we can't calculate A from k exactly unless we assume A = k (max rate). *Correction*: Key B ($6\\times 10^5$) might be correct if the question implies the rate constant *is* the frequency factor (Ea=0) or asking for the limit of k?"
