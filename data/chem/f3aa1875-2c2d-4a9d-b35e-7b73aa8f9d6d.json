  "question": [
    "A mixture of phenol and aniline shows negative deviation from Raoult's law. This is due to the formation of:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Polar covalent bond"
    ],
    [
      "Non-polar covalent bond"
    ],
    [
      "Intermolecular Hydrogen bond"
    ],
    [
      "Intramolecular Hydrogen bond"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "The negative deviation is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the phenolic proton and the lone pair of nitrogen in aniline, which is stronger than the individual intermolecular forces in pure phenol or aniline."
