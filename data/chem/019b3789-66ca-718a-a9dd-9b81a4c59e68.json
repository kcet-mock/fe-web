  "question": [
    "Half-life of a first order reaction is 20 seconds and initial concentration of reactant is 0.2M. The concentration of reactant left after 80 seconds is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "0.1 M"
    ],
    [
      "0.05 M"
    ],
    [
      "0.0125 M"
    ],
    [
      "0.2 M"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "80 seconds is 4 half-lives (80/20). Amount left = Initial * (1/2)^n = 0.2 * (1/2)^4 = 0.2 / 16 = 0.0125 M [cite: 1049-1054]."
