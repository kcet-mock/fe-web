  "question": [
    "The sodium fusion extract is boiled with concentrated nitric acid while testing for halogens. By doing so, it"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "helps in precipitation of AgCl"
    ],
    [
      "increases the solubility of AgCl"
    ],
    [
      "increases the concentration of <katex>$NO_{3}^{-}$</katex> ion"
    ],
    [
      "decomposes <katex>$Na_{2}S$</katex> and NaCN, if formed"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Boiling with <katex>$HNO_3$</katex> decomposes cyanides and sulphides (as gases HCN and <katex>$H_2S$</katex>) which would otherwise interfere with the silver nitrate test for halogens."
