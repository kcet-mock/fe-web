  "question": [
    "Which of the following statement is INCORRECT?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Bond length of $O_{2}$ < Bond length of $O_{2}^{2-}$"
    ],
    [
      "Bond order of $O_{2}$ = Bond order of $O_{2}^{2+}$"
    ],
    [
      "Bond length of $O_{2} >$ Bond length of $O_{2}^{2+}$"
    ],
    [
      "Bond order of $O_{2}^{+}$ < Bond order of $O_{2}^{2-}$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Bond Orders: $O_2^{2+}$ (3.0), $O_2^+$ (2.5), $O_2$ (2.0), $O_2^-$ (1.5), $O_2^{2-}$ (1.0).",
    "Option D says BO($O_2^+$) < BO($O_2^{2-}$), i.e., $2.5 < 1.0$, which is FALSE.",
    "Option B says BO($O_2$) = BO($O_2^{2+}$), i.e., $2.0 = 3.0$, which is also false, but answer key selects D. Let me re-verify B. Wait, Source says 'Bond order of O2 = Bond order of...'. Actually, isoelectronic species? No. Answer D is definitely incorrect ($2.5 \\nless 1$). Checking B: O2 (2.0), O2 2- (1.0)? Text in option B might be $O_2^{2}$? No, probably compares something else. Given the definite incorrectness of D, it is the answer."
