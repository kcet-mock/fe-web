  "question": [
    "In the reaction between hydrogen sulphide and acidified permanganate solution,"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "H2S is reduced to S, MnO4- is oxidised to Mn2+"
    ],
    [
      "H2S is oxidised to SO2, MnO4- is reduced to MnO2"
    ],
    [
      "H2S is reduced to SO2, MnO4- is oxidised to Mn2+"
    ],
    [
      "H2S is oxidised to S, MnO4- is reduced to Mn2+"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "The reaction is: 5H2S + 2MnO4- + 6H+ -> 5S + 2Mn2+ + 8H2O.",
    "H2S is oxidised to Sulphur (S) and MnO4- is reduced to Mn2+ [cite: 559-567]."
