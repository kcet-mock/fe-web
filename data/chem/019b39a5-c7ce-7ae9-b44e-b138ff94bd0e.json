  "question": [
    "Identify the incorrect statement from the following:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Oxides of nitrogen in the atmosphere can cause depletion of the ozone layer"
    ],
    [
      "Ozone absorbs the intense ultraviolet radiation of Sun"
    ],
    [
      "Depletion of ozone layer is because of its chemical reactions with chlorofluoro alkanes"
    ],
    [
      "Ozone absorbs infrared radiation"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Ozone primarily absorbs ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun, protecting the Earth's surface.",
    "While ozone is a greenhouse gas and interacts with IR, the statement regarding its primary protective function or characteristic absorption in the context of stratospheric ozone emphasizes UV absorption. However, chemically, ozone depletion is indeed caused by NOₓ and CFCs. The statement 'Ozone absorbs infrared radiation' is technically true in the context of the greenhouse effect, but in the context of these options, it is often flagged as the 'incorrect' or least relevant descriptor compared to its UV shielding role, or the question implies a specific context where UV is the focus. According to the answer key, D is the intended incorrect statement."
