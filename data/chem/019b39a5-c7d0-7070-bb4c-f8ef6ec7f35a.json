  "question": [
    "8.8 g of monohydric alcohol added to ethyl magnesium iodide in ether liberates 2240 cm³ of ethane at STP. This monohydric alcohol when oxidised using pyridinium-chlorochromate, forms a carbonyl compound that answers silver mirror test (Tollens' test). The monohydric alcohol is:"

    [
      "2, 2-dimethyl propan-1-ol"

    [
      "2, 2-dimethyl ethan-1-ol"

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Reaction with Grignard (C₂H₅MgI): ROH + C₂H₅MgI → C₂H₆ + ROMgI.",
    "Moles of Ethane = 2240 cm³ / 22400 cm³ = 0.1 mol. Since 1 mol alcohol gives 1 mol ethane, moles of alcohol = 0.1 mol.",
    "Molar mass of alcohol = Mass/Moles = 8.8 g / 0.1 mol = 88 g/mol.",
    "Formula C₅H₁₂O matches 88 g/mol (5*12 + 12 + 16 = 88).",
    "PCC oxidation gives a compound answering Tollens' test, meaning the product is an ALDEHYDE. Thus, the alcohol must be PRIMARY.",
    "2,2-dimethylpropan-1-ol (Neopentyl alcohol) is a primary alcohol with formula C₅H₁₂O. Butan-2-ol is secondary (gives ketone). Pentan-2-ol is secondary."
