  "question": [
    "Which of the following statements are true about [NiCl4]2-?",
    "(a) The complex has tetrahedral geometry",
    "(b) Co-ordination number of Ni is 2 and oxidation state is +4",
    "(c) The complex is sp3 hybridised",
    "(d) It is a high spin complex",
    "(e) The complex is paramagnetic"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "a, c, d and e"
    ],
    [
      "a, b, d and e"
    ],
    [
      "b, c, d and e"
    ],
    [
      "a, b, c and d"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "[NiCl4]2- contains Ni2+ (3d8). Cl- is a weak field ligand, so no pairing occurs.",
    "It forms an sp3 hybridised, tetrahedral, high spin, paramagnetic complex. Statement (b) is incorrect (CN is 4, OS is +2) [cite: 602-624]."
