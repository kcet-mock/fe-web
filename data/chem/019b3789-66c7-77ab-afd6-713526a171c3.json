  "question": [
    "Arrange the following compounds in their decreasing order of reactivity towards Nucleophilic addition reaction.",
    "CH3COCH3, CH3COC2H5, CH3CHO"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "CH3CHO > CH3COCH3 > CH3COC2H5"
    ],
    [
      "CH3COCH3 > CH3CHO > CH3COC2H5"
    ],
    [
      "CH3COC2H5 > CH3COCH3 > CH3CHO"
    ],
    [
      "CH3CHO > CH3COC2H5 > CH3COCH3"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Aldehydes are more reactive than ketones due to steric and electronic reasons. Among ketones, less sterically hindered ones are more reactive. Order: Acetaldehyde > Acetone > Methyl ethyl ketone [cite: 946-955]."
