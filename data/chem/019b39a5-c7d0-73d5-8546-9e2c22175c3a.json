    "The complex compounds [Co(NH₃)₅SO₄]Br and [Co(NH₃)₅Br]SO₄ are:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Coordination isomers"
    ],
    [
      "Geometrical isomers"
    ],
    [
      "Optical isomers"
    ],
    [
      "Ionisation isomers"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Ionisation isomers occur when the counter ion creates a potential ligand and displaces a ligand which becomes the counter ion.",
    "Here, Sulphate (SO₄) is inside the sphere in one and outside in the other, exchanging with Bromide (Br). This is Ionisation Isomerism."
