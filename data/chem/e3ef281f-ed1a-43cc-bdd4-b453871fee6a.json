  "question": [
    "Which of the following statements are true about <katex>$[NiCl_{4}]^{2-}$</katex>?",
    "a. The complex has tetrahedral geometry",
    "b. Co-ordination number of Ni is 2 and oxidation state is +4",
    "c. The complex is <katex>$sp^{3}$</katex> hybridised",
    "d. It is a high spin complex",
    "e. The complex is paramagnetic"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "a, c, d and e"
    ],
    [
      "a, b, d and e"
    ],
    [
      "b, c, d and e"
    ],
    [
      "a, b, c and d"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "In <katex>$[NiCl_4]^{2-}$</katex>, Ni is +2 state (<katex>$3d^8$</katex>).",
    "Cl is a weak field ligand, so no pairing. Hybridization is <katex>$sp^3$</katex> (Tetrahedral).",
    "It has unpaired electrons, so paramagnetic and high spin.",
    "Statement b is false (Coord no. is 4, OS is +2)."
