      "25"
    ],
    [
      "50"
    ],
    [
      "12.5"
    ],
    [
      "87.5"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Mass of Carbon in CO₂ = (12/44) * Mass of CO₂.",
    "Mass of C = (12/44) * 0.22 = 12 * 0.005 = 0.06 g.",
    "Percentage of C = (Mass of C / Mass of Compound) * 100",
    "% C = (0.06 / 0.48) * 100 = (1/8) * 100 = 12.5%."
