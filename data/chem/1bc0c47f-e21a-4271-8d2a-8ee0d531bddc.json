  "question": [
    "Sucrose is dextrorotatory but after hydrolysis the mixture show laevorotation, this is because of:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Recemic mixture is formed"
    ],
    [
      "Laevorotation of fructose is more than dextrorotation of glucose"
    ],
    [
      "Laevorotation of glucose is more than dextrorotation of fructose"
    ],
    [
      "Sucrose is a non-reducing sugar"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Hydrolysis of sucrose gives D-(+)-glucose (dextro, +52.5°) and D-(-)-fructose (laevo, -92.4°). The net rotation is negative because the magnitude of laevorotation of fructose is greater than the dextrorotation of glucose."
