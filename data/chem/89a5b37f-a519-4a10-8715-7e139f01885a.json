  "question": [
    "The electronic configuration of X and Y are given below:",
    "X: <katex>$1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}3s^{2}3p^{3}$</katex>",
    "Y: <katex>$1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}3s^{2}3p^{5}$</katex>",
    "Which of the following is the correct molecular formula and type of bond formed between X and Y?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "<katex>$X_{3}Y$</katex>, ionic bond"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$X_{2}Y_{3}$</katex>, coordinate bond"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$XY_{3}$</katex>, covalent bond"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$X_{2}Y$</katex>, covalent bond"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "X has configuration ending in <katex>$3s^2 3p^3$</katex>, which corresponds to Phosphorus (P, valency 3 or 5).",
    "Y has configuration ending in <katex>$3s^2 3p^5$</katex>, which corresponds to Chlorine (Cl, valency 1).",
    "They form <katex>$PCl_3$</katex> (XY3), which involves sharing of electrons, hence a covalent bond."
