  "question": [
    "The sodium fusion extract is boiled with concentrated nitric acid while testing for halogens. By doing so, it"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "helps in precipitation of AgCl"
    ],
    [
      "increases the solubility of AgCl"
    ],
    [
      "increases the concentration of <katex>$\\text{NO}_3^-$</katex> ion"
    ],
    [
      "decomposes <katex>$\\text{Na}_2\\text{S}$</katex> and NaCN, if formed"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Boiling with conc. <katex>$\\text{HNO}_3$</katex> decomposes sulphides (<katex>$\\text{Na}_2\\text{S}$</katex>) and cyanides (NaCN) which would otherwise interfere with the silver nitrate test for halogens."
