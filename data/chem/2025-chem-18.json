  "question": [
    "The sodium fusion extract is boiled with concentrated nitric acid while testing for halogens. By doing so, it"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "helps in precipitation of AgCl"
    ],
    [
      "increases the solubility of AgCl"
    ],
    [
      "increases the concentration of <katex>$NO_{3}^{-}$</katex> ion"
    ],
    [
      "decomposes <katex>$Na_{2}S$</katex> and NaCN, if formed"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Boiling with conc. <katex>$HNO_3$</katex> decomposes any Cyanide (<katex>$NaCN$</katex>) or Sulphide (<katex>$Na_2S$</katex>) salts present, which would otherwise interfere with the Silver Nitrate test for halogens."
