  "question": [
    "Statement-I : Adiabatic work done is positive when work is done on the system and internal energy of the system increases.",
    "Statement – II : No work is done during free expansion of an ideal gas."
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Both statements – I and Statement – II are false"
    ],
    [
      "Statement – I is true but statement – II is false"
    ],
    [
      "Statement – I is false but statement – II is true"
    ],
    [
      "Both statements – I and Statement – II are true"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "In adiabatic process (q=0), w = delta U. Work done ON system is positive, increasing U (Statement I True). Free expansion against vacuum (Pext=0) means w=0 (Statement II True) [cite: 1005-1011]."
