  "question": [
    "Select the correct statement:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Roasting involves heating the ore in the absence of air"
    ],
    [
      "Calcination involves heating the ore above its melting point"
    ],
    [
      "Smelting involves heating the ore with suitable reducing agent and flux below its melting point"
    ],
    [
      "Calcination of calcium carbonate is endothermic"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Calcination is the process of heating ore in the absence or limited supply of air, typically to remove volatile impurities or carbon dioxide. The decomposition of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂) requires heat, making it an endothermic process.",
    "Roasting involves heating in the *presence* of air.",
    "Calcination involves heating *below* the melting point.",
    "Smelting involves heating *above* the melting point to obtain the molten metal."
