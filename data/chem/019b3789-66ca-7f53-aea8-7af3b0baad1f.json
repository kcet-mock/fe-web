  "question": [
    "The change in hybridization (if any) of the ‘Al’ atom in the following reaction is",
    "AlCl3 + Cl- -> AlCl4-"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "No change in the hybridization state"
    ],
    [
      "sp2 to sp3"
    ],
    [
      "sp3 to sp3d"
    ],
    [
      "sp to sp2"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "AlCl3 is sp2 hybridised (trigonal planar). The AlCl4- ion is sp3 hybridised (tetrahedral) [cite: 1065-1066]."
