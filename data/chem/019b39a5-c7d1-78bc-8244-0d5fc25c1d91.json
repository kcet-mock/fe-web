  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Step 1: Ethene to 1,2-Dibromoethane. Reagent P is Br₂.",
    "Step 2: 1,2-Dibromoethane to Vinyl Bromide. Dehydrohalogenation. Reagent Q is Alcoholic KOH.",
    "Step 3: Vinyl Bromide to Ethyne (Acetylene). Stronger base needed. Reagent R is NaNH₂.",
    "Step 4: Ethyne to Benzene. Cyclic polymerization. Reagent S is Red hot iron tube.",
    "Correct set: Br₂, Alc. KOH, NaNH₂, Red hot iron tube."
