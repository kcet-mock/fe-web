    "Tert-butyl methyl ether + HI -> A + B. A and B respectively are",
    "images/reaction_q29.png"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "A = CH3OH, B = Tert-butyl iodide"
    ],
    [
      "A = CH3-I, B = Tert-butyl alcohol"
    ],
    [
      "A = CH3OH, B = Tert-butyl iodide (Repeat option?)"
    ],
    [
      "A = CH3-I, B = Tert-butyl iodide (Incorrect structure)"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "The reaction of tert-butyl methyl ether with HI proceeds via SN1 mechanism because the tert-butyl carbocation is stable. Thus, Iodide attacks the tert-butyl group forming tert-butyl iodide and methanol is the leaving group [cite: 891-917]."
