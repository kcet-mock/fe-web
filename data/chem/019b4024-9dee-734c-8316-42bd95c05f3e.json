  "question": [
    "Reaction: $CH_3-CH=CH-CH_2OH \\xrightarrow{PCC} CH_3-CH=CH-CHO$. Hybridisation change involved at C-1 in the above reaction:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "$sp^2$ to $sp^3$"
    ],
    [
      "sp to $sp^2$"
    ],
    [
      "$sp^3$ to sp"
    ],
    [
      "$sp^3$ to $sp^2$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Reactant: Carbon-1 is in $-CH_2OH$. It has 4 sigma bonds (2H, 1C, 1O), so it is $sp^3$.",
    "Product: Carbon-1 is in $-CHO$ (Aldehyde). It has 3 sigma bonds (1H, 1C, 1O) and 1 pi bond, so it is $sp^2$.",
    "Change is $sp^3 \\rightarrow sp^2$."
