  "question": [
    "Propanone and Propanal are:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Position isomers"
    ],
    [
      "Functional isomers"
    ],
    [
      "Chain isomers"
    ],
    [
      "Geometrical isomers"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Propanone (CH₃COCH₃) is a ketone.",
    "Propanal (CH₃CH₂CHO) is an aldehyde.",
    "They share the same molecular formula C₃H₆O but have different functional groups. Therefore, they are functional isomers."
