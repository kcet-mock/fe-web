      "Friedel-Craft reaction"
    ],

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Aniline does not undergo Friedel-Crafts reaction.",
    "This is because the amino group ($-NH_2$) is a Lewis base and forms a salt with the Lewis acid catalyst ($AlCl_3$) used in the reaction, deactivating the benzene ring towards electrophilic substitution."
