    "Sucrose is dextrorotatory but after hydrolysis the mixture show laevorotation, this is because of"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Recemic mixture is formed."
    ],
    [
      "Laevorotation of fructose is more than dextrorotation of glucose."
    ],
    [
      "Laevorotation of glucose is more than dextrorotation of fructose."
    ],
    [
      "Sucrose is a non-reducing sugar"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Hydrolysis of sucrose (dextrorotatory, <katex>$+66.5^{\\circ}$</katex>) gives D-(+)-glucose (<katex>$+52.5^{\\circ}$</katex>) and D-(-)-fructose (<katex>$-92.4^{\\circ}$</katex>).",
    "Since the magnitude of laevorotation of fructose (<katex>$-92.4^{\\circ}$</katex>) is greater than the dextrorotation of glucose (<katex>$+52.5^{\\circ}$</katex>), the resulting mixture is laevorotatory.",
    "This product is known as Invert Sugar."
