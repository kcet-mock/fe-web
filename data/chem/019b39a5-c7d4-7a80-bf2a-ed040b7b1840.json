    "From the diagram, ΔH for the reaction C → A is",
    "images/e7a5b6c8-d9f0-8a5b-2c3d-456789012345.png"
  ],

    [
      "+35 J"
    ],
    [
      "-15 J"
    ],
    [
      "-35 J"
    ],
    [
      "+15 J"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "According to Hess's Law, the enthalpy change is independent of the path.",
    "Path A → 2B → C has ΔH = ΔH₁ + ΔH₂ = 10 + 25 = 35 J.",
    "So, ΔH(A→C) = +35 J.",
    "The question asks for C → A. This is the reverse reaction.",
    "ΔH(C→A) = -ΔH(A→C) = -35 J."
