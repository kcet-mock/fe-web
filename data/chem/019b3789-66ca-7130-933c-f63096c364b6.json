  "question": [
    "For the reaction 2N2O5 -> 4NO2 + O2, initial concentration of N2O5 is 12.0 mol/L and after 300 min, it is reduced to 11.4 mol/L. The rate of production of NO2 (in mol L-1 min-1) is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "42.5 * 10^-4"
    ],
    [
      "44 * 10^-3"
    ],
    [
      "32.5 * 10^-4"
    ],
    [
      "4 * 10^-3"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Rate of disappearance of N2O5 = (12.0-11.4)/300 = 0.6/300 = 2e-3. Rate of production of NO2 = 2 * Rate of N2O5 = 4 * 10^-3. (Option 4 corresponds to this value based on solution context) [cite: 1056-1057]."
