  "question": [
    "Match the following with their pKa values:",
    "I. Phenol, II. p-Nitrophenol, III. Ethyl alcohol, IV. Picric acid",
    "a. 16, b. 0.78, c. 10, d. 7.1"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "I-c, II-d, III-a, IV-b"
    ],
    [
      "I-a, II-d, III-c, IV-b"
    ],
    [
      "I-a, II-b, III-c, IV-d"
    ],
    [
      "I-b, II-a, III-d, IV-c"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Acidity order: Picric acid (strongest) > p-Nitrophenol > Phenol > Ethyl alcohol.",
    "Lower pKa = Stronger acid.",
    "Picric acid ~ 0.78 (b)",
    "p-Nitrophenol ~ 7.1 (d)",
    "Phenol ~ 10 (c)",
    "Ethyl alcohol ~ 16 (a)"
