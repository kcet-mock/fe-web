  "question": [
    "Which of the following system in an octahedral complex has maximum unpaired electrons?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "<katex>$d^{4}$</katex> (low spin)"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$d^{7}$</katex> (high spin)"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$d^{9}$</katex> (high spin)"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$d^{6}$</katex> (low spin)"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "<katex>$d^7$</katex> high spin (<katex>$t_{2g}^5 e_g^2$</katex>) has 3 unpaired electrons. <katex>$d^4$</katex> low spin has 2. <katex>$d^6$</katex> low spin has 0. <katex>$d^9$</katex> has 1."
