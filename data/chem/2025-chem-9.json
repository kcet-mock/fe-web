    "Which of the following statements are true about <katex>$[NiCl_4]^{2-}$</katex>?",
    "a. The complex has tetrahedral geometry",
    "b. Co-ordination number of Ni is 2 and oxidation state is +4",
    "c. The complex is <katex>$sp^3$</katex> hybridised",
    "d. It is a high spin complex",
    "e. The complex is paramagnetic"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "a, c, d and e"
    ],
    [
      "a, b, d and e"
    ],

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "For <katex>$[NiCl_4]^{2-}$</katex>:",
    "Oxidation state of Ni is +2.",
    "Coordination number is 4.",
    "Cl is a weak field ligand, so no pairing occurs.",
    "Configuration is <katex>$3d^8$</katex> leading to <katex>$sp^3$</katex> hybridization (Tetrahedral).",
    "It has unpaired electrons, so it is paramagnetic and high spin."
