  "question": [
    "Which of the following statements are true about <katex>$[NiCl_{4}]^{2-}$</katex>?",
    "(a) The complex has tetrahedral geometry",
    "(b) Co-ordination number of Ni is 2 and oxidation state is +4",
    "(c) The complex is <katex>$sp^{3}$</katex> hybridised",
    "(d) It is a high spin complex",
    "(e) The complex is paramagnetic"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "a, c, d and e"
    ],
    [
      "a, b, d and e"
    ],
    [
      "b, c, d and e"
    ],
    [
      "a, b, c and d"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "In <katex>$[NiCl_{4}]^{2-}$</katex>, Ni is in +2 oxidation state with coordination number 4.",
    "Cl is a weak field ligand, so no pairing occurs.",
    "Configuration is <katex>$3d^8$</katex>.",
    "Hybridization is <katex>$sp^3$</katex> (Tetrahedral).",
    "It is paramagnetic due to unpaired electrons."
