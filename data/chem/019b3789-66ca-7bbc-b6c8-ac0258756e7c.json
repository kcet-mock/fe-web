  "question": [
    "Given below are the atomic masses of the elements: Li(7), Na(23), Cl(35.5), K(39), Ca(40), Br(80), Sr(88), I(127), Ba(137). Which of the following doesn’t form triad?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Ba, Sr, Ca"
    ],
    [
      "Cl, Br, I"
    ],
    [
      "Cl, K, Ca"
    ],
    [
      "Li, Na, K"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Dobereiner's triads consist of chemically similar elements. Cl (Non-metal), K (Alkali metal), and Ca (Alkaline earth) have different properties and do not form a triad [cite: 1063-1065]."
