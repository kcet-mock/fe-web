    "A pair of amphoteric oxides is:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "BeO, MgO"
    ],
    [
      "BeO, ZnO"
    ],
    [
      "$Al_{2}O_{3}$, $Li_{2}O$"
    ],
    [
      "BeO, $BO_{3}$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Amphoteric oxides react with both acids and bases.",
    "BeO and ZnO are classic examples of amphoteric oxides.",
    "MgO is basic, $Li_2O$ is basic, Boron oxides are acidic."
