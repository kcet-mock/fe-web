  "question": [
    "Identify the incorrect statement:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Values of colligative properties of colloidal solution are of small order compared to values of true solution"
    ],
    [
      "Tyndall effect is observed only when diameter of the dispersed particles is not much smaller than wavelength of incident light"
    ],
    [
      "Colour of colloidal solution depends on the wavelength of light scattered by the dispersed particles"
    ],
    [
      "Brownian movement is due to balanced bombardment of molecules of dispersion medium on colloidal particles"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Brownian movement is due to the *unbalanced* bombardment of the particles of the dispersion medium on the colloidal particles.",
    "Balanced bombardment would result in no net movement."
