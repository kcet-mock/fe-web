  "question": [
    "The electronic conductance depends on"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Nature of electrolyte added"
    ],
    [
      "The number of valence electrons per atom"
    ],
    [
      "Concentration of the electrolyte"
    ],
    [
      "Size of the ions"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Electronic (metallic) conductance depends on the nature of the metal, number of valence electrons, and temperature. The other options refer to electrolytic conductance [cite: 1040-1041]."
