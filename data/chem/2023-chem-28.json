  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "BeO, MgO"
    ],
    [
      "BeO, ZnO"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$Al_{2}O_{3}, Li_{2}O$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "BeO, <katex>$BO_{3}$</katex>"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Amphoteric oxides can react with both acids and bases.",
    "**BeO** and **ZnO** are both well-known amphoteric oxides.",
    "MgO and Li2O are basic. B2O3 is acidic."
