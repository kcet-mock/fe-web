  "question": [
    "Which of the following monomers form biodegradable polymers?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Phenol and formaldehyde"
    ],
    [
      "3-hydroxybutanoic acid and 3-hydroxypentanoic acid"
    ],
    [
      "Ethylene glycol and pthalic acid"
    ],
    [
      "Caprolactum and 1,3- Butadiene"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "**3-hydroxybutanoic acid and 3-hydroxypentanoic acid** copolymerize to form **PHBV** (Poly <katex>$\\beta$</katex>-hydroxybutyrate-co-<katex>$\\beta$</katex>-hydroxyvalerate), which is a biodegradable polymer.",
    "Phenol and formaldehyde form Bakelite (non-biodegradable).",
    "Ethylene glycol and phthalic acid form Glyptal (non-biodegradable).",
    "Caprolactum forms Nylon-6 (non-biodegradable)."
