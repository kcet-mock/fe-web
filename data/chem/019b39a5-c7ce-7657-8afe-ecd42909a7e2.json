  "question": [
    "Sodium ethanoate on heating with soda lime give 'X'. Electrolysis of aqueous solution of sodium ethanoate gives 'Y', 'X' and 'Y' respectively are:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Methane and Ethane"
    ],
    [
      "Methane and Methane"
    ],
    [
      "Ethane and Methane"
    ],
    [
      "Ethane and Ethane"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Decarboxylation with soda lime (NaOH + CaO): CH₃COONa → CH₄ (Methane) + Na₂CO₃. So X is Methane.",
    "Kolbe's Electrolysis: 2CH₃COO⁻ → C₂H₆ (Ethane) + 2CO₂ + 2e⁻. So Y is Ethane."
