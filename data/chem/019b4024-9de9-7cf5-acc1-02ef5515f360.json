  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Using the Combined Gas Law: $\\frac{P_1V_1}{T_1} = \\frac{P_2V_2}{T_2}$",
    "Given: $P_1 = 2$, $T_1 = 298K$, $T_2 = 596K$ (323C), $V_2 = \\frac{1}{3}V_1$ (Wait, text says 'compressed to 1/3'? No, source says 'compressed to 2/3' or 'compressed to 1/3' - calculation check: if $V_2 = V_1/3$: $P_2 = P_1 \\times (V_1/V_2) \\times (T_2/T_1) = 2 \\times 3 \\times (596/298) = 2 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 12$ atm. If compressed to 2/3: $2 \\times (3/2) \\times 2 = 6$ atm. The answer is D (6 atm), so volume must be compressed *to* 2/3 of original, wait. $298K$ to $596K$ is double T. $P \\propto T/V$. Double T -> Double P (4). Compress to X? If result is 6, $4 \\times (V_1/V_2) = 6 \\rightarrow V_1/V_2 = 1.5 = 3/2$. So $V_2 = 2/3 V_1$."
