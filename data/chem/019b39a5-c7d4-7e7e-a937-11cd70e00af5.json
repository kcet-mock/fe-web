  "question": [
    "Identify the wrong relation for real gases"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Z = V_ideal / V_real"
    ],
    [
      "P_ideal = P_real + an²/V²"
    ],
    [
      "V_real = V_ideal - nb"
    ],
    [
      "(p + a/V²)(V-b) = RT"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Compressibility factor Z is defined as PV_real / nRT.",
    "Since V_ideal = nRT/P, Z = V_real / V_ideal.",
    "Option A states Z = V_ideal / V_real, which is the inverse and thus wrong."
