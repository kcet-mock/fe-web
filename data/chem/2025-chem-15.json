  "choices": [
    [
      "It is difficult to identify the end point"
    ],
    [
      "Nitric acid doesn't act as an indicator"

  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Nitric acid (<katex>$\\text{HNO}_3$</katex>) is a strong oxidizing agent itself and would interfere with the redox titration by oxidizing the ferrous ions."
