  "question": [
    "Which one of the following does not represent Arrhenius equation?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "log k = log A - Ea / (2.303 RT)"
    ],
    [
      "k = A e^(-Ea/RT)"
    ],
    [
      "ln k = -Ea/RT + ln A"
    ],
    [
      "k = A e^(Ea/RT)"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "The Arrhenius equation is k = A * exp(-Ea/RT).",
    "Option D has a positive exponent (Ea/RT), which implies rate increases with barrier height or decreases with temperature, which is incorrect."
