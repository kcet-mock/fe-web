  "question": [
    "The correct statement/s about Galvanic cell is/are",
    "(a) Current flows from cathode to anode",
    "(b) Anode is positive terminal",
    "(c) If <katex>$E_{cell} < 0$</katex>, then it is spontaneous reaction",
    "(d) Cathode is positive terminal"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "a and b only"
    ],
    [
      "a, b and c"
    ],

    ],
    [
      "b only"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "(a) Correct: Conventional current flows cathode (+) to anode (-). Electrons flow anode to cathode.",
    "(b) Incorrect: Anode is negative.",
    "(c) Incorrect: <katex>$E_{cell}$</katex> must be positive for spontaneity.",
    "(d) Correct: Cathode is positive."
