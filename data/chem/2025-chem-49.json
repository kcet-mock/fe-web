  "question": [
    "The correct statement/s about Galvanic cell is/are",
    "(a) Current flows from cathode to anode",
    "(b) Anode is positive terminal",
    "(c) If <katex>$E_{cell} < 0$</katex>, then it is spontaneous reaction",
    "(d) Cathode is positive terminal"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "a and b only"
    ],
    [
      "a, b and c"
    ],
    [
      "a and d only"
    ],
    [
      "b only"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "In a Galvanic cell:",
    "(a) Electrons flow anode to cathode, so conventional current flows cathode to anode. (True)",
    "(b) Anode is the negative terminal. (False)",
    "(c) Spontaneous reactions have <katex>$E_{cell} > 0$</katex>. (False)",
    "(d) Cathode is the positive terminal. (True)"
