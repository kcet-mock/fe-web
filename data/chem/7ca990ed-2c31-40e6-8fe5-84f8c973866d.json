  "question": [
    "The incorrect statement about Hall-Heroult process is:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Carbon anode is oxidised to CO and <katex>$CO_{2}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$Na_{3}AlF_{6}$</katex> helps to decrease the melting point of the electrolyte"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$CaF_{2}$</katex> helps to increase the conductivity of the electrolyte"
    ],
    [
      "Oxidation state of oxygen changes in the overall cell reaction"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "In the Hall-Heroult process, purified alumina (<katex>$Al_2O_3$</katex>) is electrolyzed. The oxygen from alumina reacts with the carbon anode to form CO and <katex>$CO_2$</katex>. The oxidation state of oxygen in <katex>$Al_2O_3$</katex> is -2, and in CO or <katex>$CO_2$</katex>, it remains -2. Thus, the oxidation state of oxygen does not change in the overall reaction."
