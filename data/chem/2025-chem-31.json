  "question": [
    "Statement - I: Reduction of ester by DIBAL-H followed by hydrolysis gives aldehyde.",
    "Statement - II: Oxidation of benzyl alcohol with aqueous <katex>$KMnO_{4}$</katex> leads to the formation of Benzaldehyde.",
    "Among the above statements, identify the correct statement."
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Both statements - I and II are false"
    ],
    [
      "Statement - I is true but statement - II is false"
    ],
    [
      "Statement - I is false but statement - II is true"
    ],
    [
      "Both statements - I and II are true"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Statement I is true: DIBAL-H reduces esters to aldehydes.",
    "Statement II is false: Strong oxidizing agents like <katex>$KMnO_4$</katex> oxidize benzyl alcohol directly to Benzoic Acid, not Benzaldehyde."
