    "2-Methyl propane can be prepared by Wurtz reaction. The haloalkanes taken along with metallic sodium and dry ether are:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "chloromethane and 2-chloropropane"
    ],
    [
      "chloroethane and chloromethane"
    ],
    [
      "chloroethane and 1-chloropropane"
    ],
    [
      "chloromethane and 1-chloropropane"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Wurtz reaction couples two alkyl groups. To form 2-methylpropane (isobutane, <katex>$(CH_3)_2CH-CH_3$</katex>), one needs a methyl group (<katex>$CH_3-$</katex>) and an isopropyl group (<katex>$(CH_3)_2CH-$</katex>). Thus, chloromethane and 2-chloropropane are required."
