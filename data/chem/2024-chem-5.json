  "question": [
    "The incorrect statement about Hall-Heroult process is : [cite: 30]"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Carbon anode is oxidised to CO and <katex>$CO_{2}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$Na_{3}AlF_{6}$</katex> helps to decrease the melting point of the electrolyte"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$CaF_{2}$</katex> helps to increase the conductivity of the electrolyte"
    ],
    [
      "Oxidation state of oxygen changes in the overall cell reaction"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "In the Hall-Heroult process, the oxidation state of oxygen remains -2 throughout (in Alumina and in the oxides of carbon produced). Thus, the statement that the oxidation state of oxygen changes is incorrect. [cite: 36, 37]"
