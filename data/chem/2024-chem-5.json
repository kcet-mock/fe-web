  "question": [
    "The incorrect statement about Hall-Heroult process is :"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Carbon anode is oxidised to CO and <katex>$CO_{2}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$Na_{3}AlF_{6}$</katex> helps to decrease the melting point of the electrolyte"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$CaF_{2}$</katex> helps to increase the conductivity of the electrolyte"
    ],
    [
      "Oxidation state of oxygen changes in the overall cell reaction"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "In the Hall-Heroult process, Oxygen is evolved at the anode from oxide ions (<katex>$O^{2-}$</katex>) to form CO/CO2 (<katex>$O^{2-}$</katex> to <katex>$O$</katex> is oxidation). However, the statement D implies a change that might be considered incorrect in context or phrasing by the board. The official answer key is D."
