    "In the following scheme of reaction, X, Y and Z respectively are:",
    "images/d0f8a9b1-c2e3-1f8a-5b6c-789012345678.png"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "AgF, alcoholic KOH and benzene"
    ],
    [
      "HF, aqueous KOH and Na in dry ether"
    ],
    [
      "Hg₂F₂, alcoholic KOH and Na in dry ether"
    ],
    [
      "CoF₂, aqueous KOH and benzene"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Starting material: C₂H₅Cl (Ethyl chloride).",
    "X → C₂H₅F (Ethyl fluoride): This is the Swarts reaction, using metallic fluorides like AgF, Hg₂F₂, CoF₂. Hg₂F₂ is a valid reagent.",
    "Y → CH₂=CH₂ (Ethene): This is dehydrohalogenation (elimination), requiring Alcoholic KOH.",
    "Z → C₄H₁₀ (Butane): This is the Wurtz reaction (doubling carbon chain), using Na in dry ether.",
    "Option C matches all reagents: Hg₂F₂, Alc. KOH, Na/ether."
