    "During the electrolysis of brine, by using inert electrodes:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Na deposits on cathode"
    ],
    [
      "$Cl_2$ liberates at anode"
    ],
    [
      "$O_2$ liberates at anode"
    ],
    [
      "$H_2$ liberates at anode"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Electrolysis of Brine (aqueous NaCl):",
    "Anode (+): $2Cl^- \\rightarrow Cl_2 + 2e^-$ (Oxidation). Chlorine gas is liberated.",
    "Cathode (-): $2H_2O + 2e^- \\rightarrow H_2 + 2OH^-$ (Reduction of water is preferred over Na+)."
