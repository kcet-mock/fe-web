  "question": [
    "For the formation of which compound in Ellingham diagram <katex>$\\Delta G^{\\circ}$</katex> becomes more and more negative with increase in temperature?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "ZnO"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$Cu_{2}O$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "CO"
    ],
    [
      "FeO"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "For the reaction <katex>$2C + O_2 \\to 2CO$</katex>, the number of gaseous moles increases, so entropy change is positive. Thus, <katex>$\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S$</katex> becomes more negative as T increases."
