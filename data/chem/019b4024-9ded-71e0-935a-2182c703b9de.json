  "question": [
    "Which of the following is CORRECT with respect to melting point of a transition element?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "$Mn > Fe$"
    ],
    [
      "$Ti > V$"
    ],
    [
      "$V > Cr$"
    ],
    [
      "$Cr > Mn$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Manganese (Mn) has a surprisingly low melting point due to its stable half-filled d5 configuration leading to weaker metallic bonding compared to its neighbors.",
    "Chromium (Cr) has a much higher melting point. So $Cr > Mn$ is correct."
