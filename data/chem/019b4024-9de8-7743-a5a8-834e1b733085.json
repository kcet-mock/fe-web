  "question": [
    "A better reagent to oxidize primary alcohols into aldehyde is:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Acidified $K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7}$"
    ],
    [
      "$CrO_{3}$"
    ],
    [
      "PCC"
    ],
    [
      "Alkaline $KMnO_{4}$"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "PCC (Pyridinium Chlorochromate) is a mild oxidizing agent that oxidizes primary alcohols selectively to aldehydes without further oxidation to carboxylic acids.",
    "Stronger agents like $KMnO_4$ or $K_2Cr_2O_7$ would oxidize the alcohol directly to carboxylic acid."
