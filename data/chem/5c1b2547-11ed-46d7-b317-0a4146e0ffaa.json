  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Reaction of ether with HI.",
    "If one group is tertiary (t-butyl), the reaction proceeds via SN1 mechanism. The iodide attacks the stable tertiary carbocation.",
    "Wait, answer key says 3? Let me check the source snippet.",
    "Snippet says 'Ans. 3'. Option 3 in text is 'A=CH3OH, B=t-Butyl-I' (Actually looks like Option 1 in structure). Let's re-read image.",
    "Image for Q29 shows: Option 1: A=CH3OH, B=t-Butyl-OH. Option 2: A=CH3I, B=t-Butyl-OH. Option 3: A=CH3OH, B=t-Butyl-I. Option 4: A=CH3I, B=t-Butyl-I.",
    "Standard Chemistry: t-Butyl methyl ether + HI -> t-Butyl Iodide + Methanol (SN1).",
    "So A=Methanol, B=t-Butyl Iodide. Matches Option 3 in the snippet logic."
