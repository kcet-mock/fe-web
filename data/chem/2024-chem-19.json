  "question": [
    "8.8 g of monohydric alcohol added to ethyl magnesium iodide in ether liberates 2240 cm³ of ethane at STP. This monohydric alcohol when oxidised using pyridinium-chlorochromate, forms a carbonyl compound that answers silver mirror test (Tollens' test). The monohydric alcohol is: [cite: 150-152]"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "butan-2-ol"
    ],
    [
      "2, 2-dimethyl propan-1-ol"
    ],
    [
      "pentan-2-ol"
    ],
    [
      "2, 2-dimethyl ethan-1-ol"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "The liberation of ethane indicates active hydrogen. PCC oxidation to a compound that gives a positive Tollens' test implies the alcohol is a primary alcohol (oxidizes to aldehyde). 2,2-dimethylpropan-1-ol is a primary alcohol compatible with the data. [cite: 155, 156]"
