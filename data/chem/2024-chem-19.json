  "question": [
    "8.8 g of monohydric alcohol added to ethyl magnesium iodide in ether liberates 2240 cm³ of ethane at STP. This monohydric alcohol when oxidised using pyridinium-chlorochromate, forms a carbonyl compound that answers silver mirror test (Tollens' test). The monohydric alcohol is:"

  "choices": [
    [
      "butan-2-ol"
    ],
    [
      "2, 2-dimethyl propan-1-ol"
    ],
    [
      "pentan-2-ol"
    ],
    [
      "2, 2-dimethyl ethan-1-ol"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Moles of ethane = 2240/22400 = 0.1 mol. This corresponds to 0.1 mol of alcohol. Molar mass = 8.8/0.1 = 88 g/mol. Formula <katex>$C_5H_{12}O$</katex>. Since it oxidizes to an aldehyde (positive Tollens), it is a primary alcohol. 2,2-dimethylpropan-1-ol is primary and has M=88."
