    "Dimerisation of solute molecules in low dielectric constant solvent is due to :"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Co-ordinate bond"
    ],
    [
      "Ionic bond"
    ],
    [
      "Hydrogen bond"
    ],
    [
      "Covalent bond"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "In solvents with low dielectric constants (like benzene), solute molecules like carboxylic acids (e.g., acetic acid) undergo association or dimerisation.",
    "This is mainly due to the formation of intermolecular **Hydrogen bonds**."
