  "question": [
    "The equilibrium constant at 298K for the reaction A + B <=> C + D is 100. If the initial concentrations of all the four species were 1M each, then equilibrium concentration of D (in mol L-1) will be"

    [
      "0.182"
    ],
    [
      "1.818"

    [
      "1.182"
    ],
    [
      "0.818"

  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Since K=100 > Q=1, reaction moves forward. 100 = (1+x)^2 / (1-x)^2. 10 = (1+x)/(1-x). 10-10x=1+x. 11x=9. x=0.818. [D] = 1+x = 1.818 [cite: 1022-1023]."
