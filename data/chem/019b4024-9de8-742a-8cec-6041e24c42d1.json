  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "1. The reduction of nitrile ($C_6H_5CN$) to aldehyde ($C_6H_5CHO$, X) using $SnCl_2/HCl$ is the Stephen reaction.",
    "2. The reaction of benzaldehyde (X, which lacks alpha-hydrogens) with conc. KOH to form Benzyl alcohol (Y) and Potassium benzoate (Z) is the Cannizzaro reaction."
