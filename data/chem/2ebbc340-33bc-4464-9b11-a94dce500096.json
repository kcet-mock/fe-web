  "question": [
    "Identify the incorrect statements among the following:",
    "(a) All enthalpies of fusion are positive",
    "(b) The magnitude of enthalpy change does not depend on the strength of the intermolecular interactions",
    "(c) When a chemical reaction is reversed, the value of <katex>$\\Delta_r H^{\\circ}$</katex> is reversed in sign",
    "(d) The change in enthalpy is dependent of path between initial state and final state",
    "(e) For most of the ionic compounds, <katex>$\\Delta_{sol}H^{\\circ}$</katex> is negative"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "a, b and d"
    ],
    [
      "b, d and e"
    ],
    [
      "a, d and e"
    ],
    [
      "a and e only"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "b is incorrect: Enthalpy depends on interaction strength.",
    "d is incorrect: Enthalpy is a state function (independent of path).",
    "e is incorrect: Solution enthalpy can be positive or negative (often positive for many ionic solids, though depends on lattice vs hydration energy). The key marks this combination."
