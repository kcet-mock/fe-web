  "question": [
    "Identify the incorrect statements among the following:",
    "(a) All enthalpies of fusion are positive",
    "(b) The magnitude of enthalpy change does not depend on the strength of the intermolecular interactions",
    "(c) When a chemical reaction is reversed, the value of delta H is reversed in sign.",
    "(d) The change in enthalpy is dependent of path between initial state and final state",
    "(e) For most of the ionic compounds, delta sol H is negative"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "a, b and d"
    ],
    [
      "b, d and e"
    ],
    [
      "a, d and e"
    ],
    [
      "a and e only"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "b is incorrect (it does depend). d is incorrect (enthalpy is a state function, independent of path). e is incorrect (solvation enthalpy is often positive for many salts, though can be negative; generally generalizations are tricky, but text identifies b, d, e as incorrect set) [cite: 1013-1016]."
