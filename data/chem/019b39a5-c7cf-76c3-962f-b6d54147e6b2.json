  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "The official answer key marks this as 'Bonus'.",
    "The visual representation in the source might be ambiguous or contain errors. However, questions involving structures of artificial sweeteners like Saccharin, Aspartame, Sucralose, and Alitame are common. Based on standard chemistry curricula: Saccharin is an imide; Aspartame is a methyl ester of a dipeptide; Alitame contains a thietane ring. Without a clear structure, the bonus status suggests an error in the question or diagram."
