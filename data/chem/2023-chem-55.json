  "question": [
    "In which one of the following pairs, both the elements does not have <katex>$(n-1)d^{10}ns^{2}$</katex> configuration in its elementary state?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Hg, Cn"
    ],
    [
      "Cu, Zn"
    ],
    [
      "Zn, Cd"
    ],
    [
      "Cd, Hg"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "The configuration <katex>$(n-1)d^{10} ns^2$</katex> corresponds to Group 12 elements (Zn, Cd, Hg, Cn).",
    "Option B contains **Cu** (Copper) and Zn (Zinc).",
    "Copper has the configuration <katex>$3d^{10} 4s^1$</katex>, which is NOT <katex>$(n-1)d^{10} ns^2$</katex>.",
    "Therefore, this pair contains an element that does not match the configuration.",
    "(Note: The question phrasing implies finding the pair where the rule fails. Since Cu fails, B is the correct choice)."
