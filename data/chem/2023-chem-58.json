  "question": [
    "Which of the following is an organometallic compound?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "<katex>$(CH_{3}COO)_{2}Ca$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$CH_{3}ONa$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$CH_{3}COONa$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$CH_{3}CH_{2}MgBr$</katex>"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "An organometallic compound must contain a direct metal-carbon bond.",
    "Option D, which represents a Grignard reagent (Ethylmagnesium bromide), has a C-Mg bond.",
    "(Note: The original text might have been truncated to 'CH3CH2', but D is the intended answer in the context of organometallics vs salts)."
