  "question": [
    "Which of the following statements are true about <katex>$[CoF_{6}]^{3-}$</katex> ion?",
    "I. The complex has octahedral geometry.",
    "II. Coordination number of Co is 3 and oxidation state is + 6.",
    "III. The complex is <katex>$sp^{3}d^{2}$</katex> hybridised.",
    "IV. It is a high spin complex. [cite: 191-195]"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "I, II and IV"
    ],
    [
      "I, III and IV"
    ],
    [
      "II and IV"
    ],
    [
      "II, III and IV"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "<katex>$[CoF_{6}]^{3-}$</katex> contains <katex>$Co^{3+}$</katex> with weak field <katex>$F^-$</katex> ligands. It is octahedral (Coordination number 6), outer orbital (<katex>$sp^3d^2$</katex>), and high spin. Statement II is incorrect. [cite: 198, 199]"
