  "question": [
    "Which of the following statements are true about <katex>$[CoF_{6}]^{3-}$</katex> ion?",
    "I. The complex has octahedral geometry.",
    "II. Coordination number of Co is 3 and oxidation state is + 6.",
    "III. The complex is <katex>$sp^{3}d^{2}$</katex> hybridised.",
    "IV. It is a high spin complex."
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "I, II and IV"
    ],
    [
      "I, III and IV"
    ],
    [
      "II and IV"
    ],
    [
      "II, III and IV"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Fluoride is a weak field ligand, so it forms an outer orbital (<katex>$sp^3d^2$</katex>), high spin, octahedral complex. Co is in +3 state, CN is 6. So II is false."
