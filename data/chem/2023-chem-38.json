    "During the electrolysis of brine, by using inert electrodes,"

    [
      "Na deposits on cathode"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$Cl_{2}$</katex> liberates at anode"

      "<katex>$H_{2}$</katex> liberates at anode"
    ]

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Electrolysis of Brine (Aqueous NaCl):",
    "**Anode:** <katex>$Cl^-$</katex> is oxidized to <katex>$Cl_2$</katex> gas. (Although oxidation of water to O2 is possible, Cl2 formation is preferred due to overpotential).",
    "**Cathode:** Water is reduced to <katex>$H_2$</katex> gas (since discharge potential of H+ is lower than Na+).",
    "Result: <katex>$Cl_2$</katex> at anode, <katex>$H_2$</katex> at cathode, NaOH in solution."
