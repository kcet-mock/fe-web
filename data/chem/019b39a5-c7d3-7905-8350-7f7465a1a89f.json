  "question": [
    "For the reaction, A ⇌ B, Ea = 50 kJ mol⁻¹ and ΔH = -20 kJ mol⁻¹. When a catalyst is added, Ea decreases by 10 kJ mol⁻¹. What is the Ea for the backward reaction in the presence of catalyst?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "60 kJ mol⁻¹"
    ],
    [
      "40 kJ mol⁻¹"
    ],
    [
      "70 kJ mol⁻¹"
    ],
    [
      "20 kJ mol⁻¹"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Activation energy for backward reaction without catalyst: Ea(b) = Ea(f) - ΔH = 50 - (-20) = 70 kJ/mol.",
    "Catalyst lowers activation energy for both forward and backward by the same amount (10 kJ/mol).",
    "New Ea(b)' = 70 - 10 = 60 kJ/mol."
