  "question": [
    "A weak acid with $pK_{a}$ 5.9 and weak base with $pK_{b}$ 5.8 are mixed in equal proportions. pH of the resulting solution is:"
  ],

    [
      "7"

    ],
    [
      "7.5"

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "For a salt of a weak acid and weak base, $pH = 7 + \\frac{1}{2}(pK_a - pK_b)$.",
    "$pH = 7 + 0.5(5.9 - 5.8) = 7 + 0.5(0.1) = 7 + 0.05 = 7.05$"
