  "question": [
    "A better reagent to oxidize primary alcohols into aldehyde is:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Acidified <katex>$K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "<katex>$CrO_{3}$</katex>"
    ],
    [
      "PCC"
    ],
    [
      "Alkaline <katex>$KMnO_{4}$</katex>"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Strong oxidizing agents like Acidified <katex>$K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7}$</katex> or Alkaline <katex>$KMnO_{4}$</katex> oxidize primary alcohols directly to carboxylic acids.",
    "**PCC (Pyridinium Chlorochromate)** is a mild oxidizing agent that selectively oxidizes primary alcohols to aldehydes without further oxidation to carboxylic acids."
