  "question": [
    "Following representation P, Q and R denote few steps of Griffith Experiment. Identify the correct one(s).",
    "P. R strain -> Inject into mice -> Mice die",
    "Q. S strain (Heat killed) -> Inject into mice -> Mice die",
    "R. R strain -> Inject into mice -> Mice live"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "P only"
    ],
    [
      "R only"
    ],
    [
      "P and R"
    ],
    [
      "Q and R"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "In Griffith's experiment: R strain (rough, non-virulent) does not kill mice (Mice live). S strain (smooth, virulent) kills mice. Heat-killed S strain does not kill mice. Therefore, only representation R is correct[cite: 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 154]."
