  "question": [
    "Find the correct statement.",
    "(1) Generally a gene regulates a trait, but sometimes one gene has effect on multiple traits.",
    "(2) The trait AB-blood group of man is regulated by one dominant allele and another recessive allele. Hence it is co-dominant."
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Both Statements (1) and (2) are correct."
    ],
    [
      "Statement (1) is correct."

    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Statement (1) refers to Pleiotropy, which is correct.",
    "Statement (2) is incorrect because AB blood group is an example of Co-dominance where both alleles ($I^A$ and $I^B$) are dominant and express themselves. It is not regulated by a dominant and a recessive allele together."
