  "question": [
    "Following representation P, Q and R denote few steps of Griffith Experiment. Identify the correct one(s).",
    "**P.** R strain -> Inject into mice -> Mice die",
    "**Q.** S strain (Heat killed) -> Inject into mice -> Mice die",
    "**R.** S strain (Heat killed) + R strain (Live) -> Inject into mice -> Mice die"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "P only"
    ],
    [
      "R only"
    ],
    [
      "P and R"
    ],
    [
      "Q and R"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "P is incorrect (R strain is non-virulent). Q is incorrect (Heat killed S strain is non-virulent). R is correct due to the transforming principle where live R strain is transformed into virulent S strain."
