    "Which of these is NOT an example for Adaptive radiation?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Placental mammals"
    ],

    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Darwin's finches, Australian marsupials, and Placental mammals (radiation in Australia) are classic examples of adaptive radiation. The evolution of the long-necked giraffe is an example of directional selection/evolution, not necessarily adaptive radiation from a common ancestor into diverse niches in an isolated area."
