    "s. Motor function"
  ],
  "choices": [

    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "The Medulla oblongata contains centers for respiration (1-r). The Hypothalamus controls body temperature (2-p). The Cerebral cortex contains motor areas (3-s). The Limbic system is involved in emotional reactions and olfaction (4-q)[cite: 17, 20, 21, 22, 23, 27]."
