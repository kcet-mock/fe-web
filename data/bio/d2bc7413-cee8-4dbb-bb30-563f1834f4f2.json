  "question": [
    "Find the correct statement.",
    "(1) Generally a gene regulates a trait, but sometimes one gene has effect on multiple traits.",
    "(2) The trait AB-blood group of man is regulated by one dominant allele and another recessive allele. Hence it is co-dominant."
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Both Statements (1) and (2) are correct."
    ],
    [
      "Statement (1) is correct."
    ],
    [
      "Both the Statements are wrong."
    ],
    [
      "Statement (2) is correct."
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Statement (1) describes Pleiotropy, which is correct. Statement (2) is incorrect because AB blood group is an example of Co-dominance where *both* alleles ($I^A$ and $I^B$) are dominant and expressed, not a dominant and recessive interaction."
