  "question": [
    "If two primary spermatocytes and two primary oocytes undergo meiosis simultaneously, what will be the ratio of spermatozoa and ova produced at the end of the gametogenesis?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "2:1"
    ],
    [
      "4:1"
    ],
    [

    ],
    [
      "1:2"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "One primary spermatocyte produces 4 spermatozoa, so 2 produce 8. One primary oocyte produces 1 ovum, so 2 produce 2. The ratio is 8:2, which simplifies to 4:1[cite: 99, 100, 104]."
