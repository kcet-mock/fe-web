  "question": [
    "In a population of 800 rabbits showing Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of recessive individuals was 0.16. What is the frequency of heterozygous individuals?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "0.84"
    ],
    [
      "0.4"
    ],
    [
      "0.36"
    ],
    [
      "0.48"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Frequency of recessive individuals (<katex>$q^2$</katex>) = 0.16. So, <katex>$q = 0.4$</katex>. Since <katex>$p + q = 1$</katex>, <katex>$p = 0.6$</katex>. Frequency of heterozygotes = <katex>$2pq = 2(0.6)(0.4) = 0.48$</katex>."
