  "question": [
    "In one of the hybridisation experiments, a homozygous dominant parent and a homozygous recessive parent are crossed for a trait. (Plant shows Mendelian inheritance pattern)"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Dominant parent trait appears in <katex>$F_1$</katex> generation and recessive parent trait appears in <katex>$F_1$</katex> and <katex>$F_2$</katex> generations."
    ],
    [
      "Dominant parent trait appears in <katex>$F_1$</katex> generation and recessive parent trait appears in <katex>$F_2$</katex> generation."
    ],
    [
      "Dominant parent trait appears in <katex>$F_2$</katex> generation and recessive parent trait appears only in <katex>$F_1$</katex> generation."
    ],
    [
      "Dominant parent trait appears in both <katex>$F_1$</katex> & <katex>$F_2$</katex> generations, recessive parent trait appears in only <katex>$F_2$</katex> generation."
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "In a Mendelian monohybrid cross, the <katex>$F_1$</katex> generation shows only the dominant trait. In the <katex>$F_2$</katex> generation, both dominant and recessive traits appear in a 3:1 ratio."
