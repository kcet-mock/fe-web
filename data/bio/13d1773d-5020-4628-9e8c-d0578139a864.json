  "question": [
    "The graph showing the concept of activation energy of enzyme is given below :",
    "images/0b9c1d2e-3f4a-5b6c-7d8e-9f0a1b2c3d4e.png",
    "Observe the graph and choose the correct option for M and N."
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "M-Activation energy with enzyme, N-Activation energy without enzyme"
    ],
    [
      "M-High temperature, High activation energy, N-Low temperature, Low activation energy"
    ],
    [
      "M-High substrate, High activation energy, N-Low substrate, Low activation energy"
    ],
    [
      "M-Activation energy without enzyme, N-Activation energy with enzyme"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "In the graph, curve 'M' shows a higher energy peak (without enzyme) and curve 'N' shows a lower energy peak (with enzyme), indicating the enzyme lowers the activation energy."
