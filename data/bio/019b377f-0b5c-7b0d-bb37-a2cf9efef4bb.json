  "question": [
    "Select the mismatched pair:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "First month of pregnancy - Formation of heart"
    ],
    [
      "Second month of pregnancy - Movement of foetus"
    ],
    [
      "Third month of pregnancy - Formation of most of the major organ systems"
    ],
    [
      "Sixth month of pregnancy - Eye lids separate and eye lashes are found"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "The answer key indicates option 1 is the mismatched pair in this context, although biologically the movement of the foetus typically occurs in the fifth month (making option 2 biologically incorrect as well). The heart forms after one month [cite: 60-64, 474]."
