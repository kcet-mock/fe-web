  "explanation": [
    "This question asks to identify the correct row. Row (c) has mixed up symptoms. Row (b) lists Round head for Down's (correct) but Masculine development for Turner's (incorrect). The question formatting in the source is tricky, but the key indicates option 2 (c). Looking closely at the table structure in the source: Row (c) lists 'Sterile females...' under Down's column? No, the table columns are swapped or the rows are mixed. Let's interpret the Answer Key 2. Option 2 corresponds to row (c). Wait, checking standard biology: Down's = Trisomy 21 (Broad palm, Retarded). Turner's = XO (Sterile females, rudimentary ovaries). Row (c) seems to have the description for Turner's under Down's? Or implies the match. Let's stick to the provided key."
