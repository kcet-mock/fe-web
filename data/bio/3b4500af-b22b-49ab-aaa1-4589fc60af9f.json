  "question": [
    "Which of the following statements are correct with reference to prokaryotic genome?",
    "(a) Monocistronic structural genes",
    "(b) Introns absent in structural genes",
    "(c) Transcription and translation are coupled processes",
    "(d) Primary transcript undergoes splicing",
    "(e) Only one RNA polymerase is present"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Only b, c and e are correct"
    ],
    [
      "Only a, d and e are correct"
    ],
    [
      "Only a, b and c are correct"
    ],
    [
      "Only a, b and d are correct"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Prokaryotes have Polycistronic genes (not Monocistronic). They lack introns (split genes absent). Transcription and translation are coupled. They have a single RNA polymerase. Splicing is not required. Thus, correct statements are b, c, and e."
