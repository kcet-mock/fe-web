  "question": [
    "In one of the hybridisation experiments, a homozygous dominant parent and a homozygous recessive parent are crossed for a trait. (Plant shows Mendelian inheritance pattern)"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Dominant parent trait appears in $F_1$ generation and recessive parent trait appears in $F_1$ and $F_2$ generations."
    ],
    [
      "Dominant parent trait appears in $F_1$ generation and recessive parent trait appears in $F_2$ generation."
    ],
    [
      "Dominant parent trait appears in $F_2$ generation and recessive parent trait appears only in $F_1$ generation"
    ],
    [
      "Dominant parent trait appears in both $F_1$ & $F_2$ generations, recessive parent trait appears in only $F_2$ generation."
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "In a Mendelian cross (TT x tt), the $F_1$ generation is all heterozygous dominant (Tt).",
    "The $F_2$ generation (Tt x Tt) shows a phenotypic ratio of 3:1 (Dominant:Recessive).",
    "Thus, the dominant trait appears in both generations, while the recessive trait reappears only in $F_2$."
