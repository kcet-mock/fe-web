    "Statement II: Embryos always pass through the adult stages of other animals",
    "Which of the following options is correct with reference to these statements?"
  ],

    "Statement I is correct (Recapitulation theory observation). Statement II is incorrect because embryos resemble the embryonic stages of ancestors, not the adult stages (Von Baer's law rejected Haeckel's 'ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny' in the literal sense of adult stages)[cite: 174, 177, 178, 180]."
