    "images/a6c4e3d1-0f9g-6h5c-1e7d-3c4f5g6h7i8j.png"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "'A' is a vegetative cell which gives rise to male gametes and 'B' is a generative cell which produces pollen tube"
    ],
    [
      "'A' is a generative cell which gives rise to pollen tube and 'B' is a vegetative cell which form male gametes"
    ],
    [
      "'A' is a vegetative cell with abundant food reserve and 'B' is a generative cell which form male gametes"
    ],
    [
      "'A' is a generative cell which forms male gametes and 'B' is a vegetative cell which produces pollen tube"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "In a mature pollen grain, 'A' represents the Vegetative cell, which is bigger and has abundant food reserve. 'B' represents the Generative cell, which is small, floats in the cytoplasm of the vegetative cell, and divides mitotically to form the two male gametes."
