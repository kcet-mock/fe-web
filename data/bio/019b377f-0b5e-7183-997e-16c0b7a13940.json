  "question": [
    "Which of the following statements are correct with reference to prokaryotic genome?",
    "(a) Monocistronic structural genes",
    "(b) Introns absent in structural genes",
    "(c) Transcription and translation are coupled processes",
    "(d) Primary transcript undergoes splicing",
    "(e) Only one RNA polymerase is present"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Only b, c and e are correct"
    ],
    [
      "Only a, d and e are correct"
    ],
    [
      "Only a, b and c are correct"
    ],
    [
      "Only a, b and d are correct"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "In prokaryotes, structural genes are polycistronic (not monocistronic), introns are absent, splicing does not occur, and transcription/translation are coupled. Thus statements b, c, and e are correct[cite: 122, 474]."
