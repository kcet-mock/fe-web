  "question": [
    "Histone proteins are positively charged because they are rich in basic amino acid residues"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Arginine and Phenylalanine"
    ],
    [
      "Arginine and Alanine"
    ],
    [
      "Arginine and Proline"
    ],
    [
      "Arginine and Lysine"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Histones are rich in the basic amino acid residues lysines and arginines. Both carry positive charges in their side chains, giving histones a net positive charge to bind with negatively charged DNA."
