  "question": [
    "In Structural gene, the template DNA strand has nucleotide sequences 3'-ATGCATGCATGCATGC-5'. Find the correct and complimentary nucleotide sequence on coding strand."
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "5'-ATGCATGCATGCATGC-3'"
    ],
    [
      "3'-GCATGCATGCATGCAT-5'"
    ],

      "5'-TACGTACGTACGTACG-3'"
    ],
    [
      "3'-TACGTACGTACGTACG-5'"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "The coding strand runs 5' to 3' and is complementary to the template strand (3' to 5').\nTemplate: 3'-A T G C...-5'\nCoding:   5'-T A C G...-3'\nThe sequence matches Option C."
