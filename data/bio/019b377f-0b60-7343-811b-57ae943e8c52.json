    "List-I: (a) Bioreactors, (b) Downstream processing, (c) Recombinant protein, (d) PCR",
    "List-II: i. Insulin produced by rDNA technology, ii. Vessels which convert raw material into specific Product, iii. Detect mutated genes in suspected cancer patient, iv. Involves separation and purification."
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "a-iv, b-ii, c-iii, d-i"
    ],
    [

    [
      "a-ii, b-iv, c-i, d-iii"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Bioreactors are vessels (ii); Downstream processing involves separation (iv); Recombinant protein example is Insulin (i); PCR is used to detect mutations (iii) [cite: 171-197, 476]."
