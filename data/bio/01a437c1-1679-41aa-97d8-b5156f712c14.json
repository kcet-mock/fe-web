  "question": [
    "During transcription the DNA stand with 3'→5' polarity of the structural gene always acts as a template because"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Enzyme DNA dependent RNA polymerase always catalyse polymerisation in both the directions."
    ],
    [
      "Enzyme DNA dependent RNA polymerase always catalyse the polymerisation 5'→3' directions."
    ],
    [
      "Nucleotides of DNA strand with 5'→3' are transferred to mRNA."
    ],
    [
      "Enzyme DNA dependent RNA polymerase always catalyse the polymerisation 3'→5' directions."
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyses polymerisation only in one direction, which is 5'→3'. Therefore, the strand with 3'→5' polarity acts as the template."
