  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "M-Activation energy with enzyme, N-Activation energy without enzyme"
    ],
    [
      "M-High temperature, High activation energy, N-Low temperature, Low activation energy"
    ],
    [
      "M-High substrate, High activation energy, N-Low substrate, Low activation energy"
    ],
    [
      "M-Activation energy without enzyme, N-Activation energy with enzyme"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "In the energy graph, the higher peak (M) represents the activation energy required *without* the enzyme. The lower peak (N) represents the reduced activation energy *with* the enzyme."
