  "question": [
    "Read the given statements and choose the correct option:",
    "Statement I: In Calvin cycle, Carboxylation is catalysed by PEP Carboxylase",
    "Statement II: In Hatch-Slack pathway, Carboxylation is catalysed by RuBP Carboxylase"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Statement I is true but Statement II is false"
    ],
    [
      "Statement I is false but Statement II is true"
    ],
    [
      "Both Statement I and Statement II are false"
    ],
    [
      "Both Statement I and Statement II are true"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Both statements are false. In Calvin cycle (C3), carboxylation is catalysed by RuBisCO. In Hatch-Slack (C4), the primary carboxylation is catalysed by PEP Carboxylase."
