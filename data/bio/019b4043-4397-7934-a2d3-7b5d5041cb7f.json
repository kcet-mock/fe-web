  "question": [
    "In a population of 800 rabbits showing Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of recessive individuals was 0.16. What is the frequency of heterozygous individuals?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "0.84"
    ],
    [
      "0.4"
    ],
    [
      "0.36"
    ],
    [
      "0.48"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Frequency of recessive genotype ($q^2$) = 0.16. So allele frequency $q = \\sqrt{0.16} = 0.4$.",
    "Since $p + q = 1$, $p = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6$.",
    "Frequency of heterozygous individuals = $2pq = 2 \\times 0.6 \\times 0.4 = 0.48$."
