  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Deep sea fishes have biochemical adaptations (1-q). Desert lizards show behavioral adaptation (basking) (2-p). Kangaroo rats show physiological adaptation (concentrating urine) (3-s). Opuntia shows morphological adaptation (spines) (4-r)[cite: 326, 331, 332, 334, 337, 340]."
