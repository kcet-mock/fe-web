  "question": [
    "The mRNA has Untranslated Regions (UTRs)"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "At 3'-end beyond Terminator codon"
    ],
    [
      "At 5'-end before AUG"
    ],
    [
      "At both 3'-end and 5'-end beyond Terminator codon and before AUG respectively"
    ],
    [
      "AUG and Terminator codon flanks the UTR"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "The UTRs (Untranslated Regions) are present at both the 5' -end (before the start codon) and at the 3' -end (after the stop codon)[cite: 159, 166]."
