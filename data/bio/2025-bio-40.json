  "question": [
    "A student observed the slide of mitosis under the microscope and observed that the chromosomes were placed at the opposite poles. Which stage was the student observing?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Anaphase"
    ],
    [
      "Metaphase"
    ],
    [
      "Telophase"
    ],
    [
      "Prophase"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "In Anaphase, chromosomes (sister chromatids) separate and move to opposite poles. If they are already *placed* at the poles (fully reached), it could be Telophase, but the action of being at opposite poles is the result of Anaphase. The answer key indicates option 1 (Anaphase), likely referring to the movement or completion of movement phase."
