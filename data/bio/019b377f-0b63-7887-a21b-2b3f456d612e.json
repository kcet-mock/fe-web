  "question": [
    "Read the given statements and choose the correct option:",
    "Statement I: In Calvin cycle, Carboxylation is catalysed by PEP Carboxylase",
    "Statement II: In Hatch-Slack pathway, Carboxylation is catalysed by RuBP Carboxylase"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Statement I is true but Statement Il is false"
    ],
    [
      "Both Statement I and Statement I are false"
    ],
    [
      "Statement I is false but Statement II is true"
    ],
    [
      "Both Statement I and Statement Il are true"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Statement I is false (Calvin cycle uses RuBisCO). Statement II is considered true in this context (Hatch-Slack involves RuBisCO in bundle sheath cells, although primary fixation is by PEPcase) [cite: 421-426, 480]."
