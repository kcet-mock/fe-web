    "From the following tools/techniques of genetic engineering, identify those which are required for cloning a bacterial gene in animal cells and choose the correct option:",
    "I. Endonuclease",
    "II. Ligase",
    "III. A. tumefaciens",
    "IV. Microinjection",
    "V. Gene gun",
    "VI. Lysozyme",
    "VII. Cellulase",
    "VIII. Electrophoresis"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "I, III, IV, V, VII"
    ],
    [
      "II, III, V, VII, VIII"
    ],
    [
      "II, III, IV, VI, VII, VIII"
    ],
    [
      "I, II, IV, VI, VIII"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "To clone a bacterial gene into animal cells: Restriction enzymes (Endonuclease - I) to cut DNA. Ligase (II) to join. Microinjection (IV) is a direct method for animal cells. Lysozyme (VI) to break bacterial cell wall to isolate DNA. Electrophoresis (VIII) to separate DNA fragments. *A. tumefaciens* and Gene gun are typically for plants. Cellulase is for plant cells."
