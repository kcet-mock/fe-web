  "question": [
    "Which pair of the following cells in the embryo sac are destined to change their ploidy after fertilization?"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Central cell and antipodals"
    ],
    [
      "Antipodals and synergids"
    ],
    [
      "Egg cell and central cell"
    ],
    [
      "Synergids and egg cell"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "The Egg cell (haploid) fuses with a male gamete to form a Zygote (diploid). The Central cell (polar nuclei, n+n or 2n) fuses with a male gamete to form the Primary Endosperm Nucleus (triploid). Thus, both change their ploidy. Synergids and antipodals degenerate."
