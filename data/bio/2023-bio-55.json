  "choices": [
    [
      "p-Bundle of His, q-SAN, r-Interventricular septum, s-AVN"
    ],
    [
      "p-SAN, q-AVN, r-Bundle of His, s-Interventricular septum"
    ],
    [
      "p-Interventricular septum, q-AVN, r-Bundle of His, s-SAN"
    ],
    [
      "p-AVN, q-SAN, r-Interventricular septum, s-Bundle of His"
    ]

  "explanation": [
    "In the standard diagram of the heart's conducting system: 'p' (upper right atrium) is the Sino-atrial Node (SAN), 'q' (lower left of right atrium) is the Atrio-ventricular Node (AVN), 'r' represents the Bundle of His arising from AVN, and 's' points towards the interventricular septum/bundle branches."
