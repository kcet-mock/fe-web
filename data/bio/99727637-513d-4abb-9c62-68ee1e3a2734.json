  "question": [
    "Considering the stroke volume of an adult healthy being is 70 mL, identify the cardiac output in one hour from the following:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "302.4 Lit/hour"
    ],
    [
      "5.04 Lit/hour"
    ],
    [
      "50.40 Lit/hour"
    ],
    [
      "30.24 Lit/hour"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Cardiac output = Stroke Volume × Heart Rate. Assuming 72 beats/min: 70 mL × 72 = 5040 mL/min = 5.04 L/min. In one hour (60 mins): 5.04 × 60 = 302.4 Liters."
