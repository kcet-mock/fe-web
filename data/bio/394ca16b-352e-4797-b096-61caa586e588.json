  "question": [
    "Which of the following statements are correct with reference to prokaryotic genome?",
    "(a) Monocistronic structural genes",
    "(b) Introns absent in structural genes",
    "(c) Transcription and translation are coupled processes",
    "(d) Primary transcript undergoes splicing",
    "(e) Only one RNA polymerase is present"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Only b, c and e are correct"
    ],
    [
      "Only a, d and e are correct"
    ],
    [
      "Only a, b and c are correct"
    ],
    [
      "Only a, b and d are correct"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Prokaryotic genes are polycistronic (a is false). They lack introns (b is true, d is false). Transcription and translation occur simultaneously (c is true). A single RNA polymerase catalyzes transcription of all types of RNA (e is true)."
