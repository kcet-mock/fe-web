  "question": [
    "Which of these options is true in the context of the above diagram of pollen grain?",
    "images/36148538-402f-47a4-8271-e7a2fe37debc.png"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "'A' is a vegetative cell which gives rise to male gametes and 'B' is a generative cell which produces pollen tube"
    ],
    [
      "'A' is a generative cell which gives rise to pollen tube and 'B' is a vegetative cell which form male gametes"
    ],
    [
      "'A' is a vegetative cell with abundant food reserve and 'B' is a generative cell which form male gametes"
    ],
    [
      "'A' is a generative cell which forms male gametes and 'B' is a vegetative cell which produces pollen tube"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "In a pollen grain, the larger cell 'A' is the vegetative cell which has abundant food reserve. The smaller cell 'B' is the generative cell which floats in the cytoplasm of the vegetative cell and divides to form male gametes."
