  "question": [
    "From the following tools/techniques of genetic engineering, identify those which are required for cloning a bacterial gene in animal cells and choose the correct option:",
    "I. Endonuclease, II. Ligase, III. A. tumefaciens, IV. Microinjection, V. Gene gun, VI. Lysozyme, VII. Cellulase, VIII. Electrophoresis"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "I, III, IV, V, VII"
    ],
    [
      "II, III, V, VII, VIII"
    ],
    [
      "II, III, IV, VI, VII, VIII"
    ],
    [
      "I, II, IV, VI, VIII"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "For cloning in animal cells: Restriction enzymes (Endonuclease, I) and Ligase (II) are needed for rDNA.",
    "Microinjection (IV) is a standard method for animal cells.",
    "Lysozyme (VI) is used to break bacterial cell walls to isolate the gene.",
    "Electrophoresis (VIII) is used to separate DNA fragments.",
    "A. tumefaciens (III) and Gene gun (V) are typically for plants."
