  "question": [
    "Choose the correct sequence of steps involved in decomposition"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Fragmentation -> Leaching -> Catabolism -> Mineralisation -> Humification"
    ],
    [
      "Fragmentation -> Mineralisation -> Humification -> Leaching -> Catabolism"
    ],
    [
      "Fragmentation -> Leaching -> Catabolism -> Humification -> Mineralisation"
    ],
    [
      "Fragmentation -> Catabolism -> Leaching -> Humification -> Mineralisation"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "The process of decomposition involves: Fragmentation (detritivores break down detritus), Leaching (water-soluble nutrients go down), Catabolism (enzymes break down detritus), Humification (formation of humus), and Mineralisation (release of inorganic nutrients)."
