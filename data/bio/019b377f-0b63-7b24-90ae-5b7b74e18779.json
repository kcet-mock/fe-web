  "question": [
    "The respiratory mechanism controlled by medulla oblongata can be altered by"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Chemosensitive area in the medulla"
    ],
    [
      "Both Pneumotaxic and Chemosensitive areas of pons and medulla oblongata"
    ],
    [
      "Corpus callosum of brain"
    ],
    [
      "Pneumotaxic center in the pons"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "The neural signal from the pneumotaxic center in the pons can reduce the duration of inspiration and thereby alter the respiratory rate [cite: 458-463, 480]."
