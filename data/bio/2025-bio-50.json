    "images/2025-bio-50-1.png"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "M-Activation energy with enzyme, N-Activation energy without enzyme"
    ],
    [
      "M-High temperature, High activation energy, N-Low temperature, Low activation energy"
    ],
    [
      "M-High substrate, High activation energy, N-Low substrate, Low activation energy"
    ],
    [
      "M-Activation energy without enzyme, N-Activation energy with enzyme"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Curve M represents the reaction pathway with higher energy barrier (Without Enzyme). Curve N represents the pathway with lower energy barrier (With Enzyme)."
