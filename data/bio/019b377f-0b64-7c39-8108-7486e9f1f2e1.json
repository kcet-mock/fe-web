  "question": [
    "Identify the statement/s given below that does note correspond to the functions of cortisol",
    "(i) Maintains cardiovascular system and kidney functions",
    "(ii) Produces anti-inflammatory reactions",
    "(iii) Maintains electrolyte balance, osmosis and blood pressure",
    "(iv) Suppresses immune response",
    "(v) Stimulates RBC production"

    [
      "(iii) and (v) only"

    [
      "(ii) only"

    [
      "(i) and (ii) only"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "The answer key indicates option 3 ((iv) only) as the answer. Note: Cortisol *does* suppress the immune response biologically, so this question/key combination might imply identifying a statement that *is* a function if misread, or suggesting (iv) is incorrect in a specific context, but standard biology lists immunosuppression as a function of cortisol[cite: 467, 480]."
