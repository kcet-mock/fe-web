    "During transcription the DNA strand with $3^{\\prime}\\rightarrow5^{\\prime}$ polarity of the structural gene always acts as a template because"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Enzyme DNA dependent RNA polymerase always catalyse polymerisation in bioth the directions."
    ],
    [
      "Enzyme DNA dependent RNA polymerase always catalyse the polymerisation $5^{\\prime}\\rightarrow3^{\\prime}$ directions."
    ],
    [
      "Nucleotides of DNA strand with $5^{\\prime}\\rightarrow3^{\\prime}$ are transferred to mRNA."
    ],
    [
      "Enzyme DNA dependent RNA polymerase always catalyse the polymerisation $3^{\\prime}\\rightarrow5^{\\prime}$ directions."
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "The DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyses polymerization only in the $5' \\rightarrow 3'$ direction.",
    "Therefore, the DNA strand with $3' \\rightarrow 5'$ polarity must act as the template."
