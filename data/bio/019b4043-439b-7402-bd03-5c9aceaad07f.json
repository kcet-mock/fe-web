  "question": [
    "Match column-I with column-II.",
    "1. Hypertonic -> q. External solution is more concentrated than cell sap",
    "2. Capillarity -> s. Ability of water to rise in thin tubes",
    "3. Symport -> p. Two molecules move in the same direction across the membrane",
    "4. Guttation -> r. Water loss in the form of droplets"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "1-q, 2-p, 3-s, 4-r"
    ],
    [
      "1-q, 2-s, 3-r, 4-p"
    ],
    [
      "1-q, 2-s, 3-p, 4-r"
    ],
    [
      "1-q, 2-r, 3-p, 4-s"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Hypertonic: External concentration > Internal.",
    "Capillarity: Rise in tubes.",
    "Symport: Same direction transport.",
    "Guttation: Droplet loss."
