  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "This question requires evaluating the match in the source table. Option (A) matches 'Menstruation phase' with 'Menses', which is correct. However, 'L.H. Surge' occurs at the end of the Follicular phase (Ovulatory phase), and 'Regeneration' happens in the Follicular phase. Based on the answer key provided in the source (Ans. A), this is the intended correct option despite the slight overlap in phase descriptions."
