    "During transcription the DNA strand with <katex>$3'\\rightarrow5'$</katex> polarity of the structural gene always acts as a template because"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Enzyme DNA dependent RNA polymerase always catalyses polymerisation in both the directions."
    ],
    [
      "Enzyme DNA dependent RNA polymerase always catalyses the polymerisation <katex>$5'\\rightarrow3'$</katex> directions."
    ],
    [
      "Nucleotides of DNA strand with <katex>$5'\\rightarrow3'$</katex> are transferred to mRNA."

    [
      "Enzyme DNA dependent RNA polymerase always catalyses the polymerisation <katex>$3'\\rightarrow5'$</katex> directions."
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "RNA polymerase catalyzes polymerization only in the <katex>$5' \\rightarrow 3'$</katex> direction. Therefore, the DNA strand with <katex>$3' \\rightarrow 5'$</katex> polarity acts as the template."
