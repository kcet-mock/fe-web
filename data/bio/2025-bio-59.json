  "question": [
    "Identify the correct sequence of action potential as it arrives at the axon terminal from the choices given below:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Axon terminal → Synaptic cleft → Synaptic vesicles → Post-synaptic neuron → Post-synaptic membrane"
    ],
    [
      "Axon terminal → Post-synaptic membrane → Synaptic cleft → Synaptic vesicles → Post-synaptic neuron"
    ],
    [
      "Axon terminal → Synaptic vesicles → Post-synaptic membrane → Synaptic cleft → Post-synaptic neuron"
    ],
    [
      "Axon terminal → Synaptic vesicles → Synaptic cleft → Post-synaptic membrane → Post-synaptic neuron"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "The sequence is: Axon terminal depolarizes → Synaptic vesicles fuse with membrane → Neurotransmitter released into Synaptic cleft → Binds to receptors on Post-synaptic membrane → Potential in Post-synaptic neuron."
