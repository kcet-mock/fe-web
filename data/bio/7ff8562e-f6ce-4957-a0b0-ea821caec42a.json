  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "9:1"
    ],
    [
      "3:1"
    ],

    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "In a dihybrid cross, when considering a single character (like seed shape: round vs wrinkled), the segregation ratio in <katex>$F_2$</katex> follows the monohybrid ratio of 3:1."
