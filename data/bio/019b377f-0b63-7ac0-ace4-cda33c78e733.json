  "question": [
    "The graph showing the concept of activation energy of enzyme is given below : Observe the graph and choose the correct option for M and N.",
    "images/enzyme_graph.png"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "M-Activation energy with enzyme, N-Activation energy without enzyme"
    ],
    [
      "M-High temperature, High activation energy, N-Low temperature, Low activation energy"
    ],
    [
      "M-High substrate, High activation energy, N-Low substrate, Low activation energy"
    ],
    [
      "M-Activation energy without enzyme, N-Activation energy with enzyme"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "M represents the higher activation energy required without an enzyme, and N represents the lower activation energy required in the presence of an enzyme [cite: 394-407, 480]."
