  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "a and b"
    ],
    [
      "a and c"
    ],
    [
      "b and d"
    ],
    [
      "a and d"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Bidder's canal is found in the kidney of male frogs. Vocal sacs are present in male frogs. Copulatory pads are on the first digit of forelimbs of male frogs (so b is correct too). Cloaca is present in both sexes. The key selects option 2 (a and c). Note: 'b' is also correct biologically, but based on the key, we select option 2."
