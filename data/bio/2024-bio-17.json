  "question": [
    "In a dihybrid cross between a true breeding round yellow seeded and true breeding wrinkled green seeded pea plant, the ratio of segregation of round and wrinkled seed traits in <katex>$F_{2}$</katex> is"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "9:1"
    ],
    [
      "3:1"
    ],
    [

    ],
    [
      "3:3"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Considering only the seed shape character (Round vs Wrinkled) in the <katex>$F_2$</katex> generation of a dihybrid cross, the ratio follows the monohybrid segregation of 3:1 (12 Round : 4 Wrinkled)."
