  "question": [
    "In Structural gene, the template DNA strand has nucleotide sequences 3'-ATGCATGCATGCATGC-5'. Find the correct and complimentary nucleotide sequence on coding strand."
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "5'-ATGCATGCATGCATGC-3'"
    ],
    [
      "3'-GCATGCATGCATGCAT-5'"
    ],
    [
      "5'-TACGTACGTACGTACG-3'"
    ],
    [
      "3'-TACGTACGTACGTACG-5'"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "The coding strand is complementary to the template strand (3'-5'). Therefore, A pairs with T, T with A, G with C, and C with G, oriented 5' to 3'. 3'-ATGC...-5' corresponds to 5'-TACG...-3'."
