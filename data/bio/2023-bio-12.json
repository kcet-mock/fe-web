    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": [
    "Darwin's finches, Australian marsupials, and Placental mammals are classic examples of adaptive radiation. The evolution of the long-necked giraffe is typically cited as an example of natural selection (Lamarckism vs Darwinism) but not specifically adaptive radiation from a common ancestor into diverse forms in a new area."
