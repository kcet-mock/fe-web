      "302.4 Lit/hour"
    ],
    [
      "5.04 Lit/hour"
    ],
    [
      "50.40 Lit/hour"
    ],
    [
      "30.24 Lit/hour"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": [
    "Cardiac Output = Stroke Volume x Heart Rate = 70 mL x 72 bpm = 5040 mL/min. In 1 hour: 5040 mL/min x 60 min = 302,400 mL = 302.4 Liters."
