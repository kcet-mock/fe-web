  "question": [
    "Identify the correct sequence of action potential as it arrives at the axon terminal from the choices given below:"
  ],
  "choices": [
    [
      "Axon terminal -> Synaptic cleft -> Synaptic vesicles -> Post-synaptic neuron"
    ],
    [
      "Axon terminal -> Post-synaptic membrane -> Synaptic cleft -> Synaptic vesicles"
    ],
    [
      "Axon terminal -> Synaptic vesicles -> Post-synaptic membrane -> Synaptic cleft"
    ],
    [
      "Axon terminal -> Synaptic vesicles -> Synaptic cleft -> Post-synaptic membrane"
    ]
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": [
    "Arrival at Axon terminal -> Stimulates Synaptic vesicles to fuse with membrane -> Release neurotransmitter into Synaptic cleft -> Binds to receptors on Post-synaptic membrane."
